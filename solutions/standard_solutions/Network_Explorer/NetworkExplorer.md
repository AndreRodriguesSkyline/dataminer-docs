The Network Explorer allows you to monitor your IP network as efficiently as possible.

Once it has been deployed, you can find the Network Explorer app on the root page of your DataMiner System.

Initially, you may need to start a scan of the network in order to [get started with Network Explorer](xref:NetworkExplorer_getting_started).

For an overview of the supported infrastructure, refer to [Supported devices and protocols](xref:NetworkExplorer_Supported_Devices_And_Protocols).
