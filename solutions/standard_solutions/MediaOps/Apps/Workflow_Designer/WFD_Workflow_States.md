# Workflow States

A workflow can be in one of the following states:

- **Draft**: In this stage the workflow is not (yet) available to be used as template for the creation of jobs.
- **Complete**: In this stage the resource pool is considered complete and can be used to create workflows and jobs.
- **Obsolete**<!-- : TBC WITH THE TEAM WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHY NOT DEPRECATED AS IN OTHER OBJECTS? => HAS TO BE DEPRECATED -->
- **Error**<!-- : TBC WITH THE TEAM IF IT CAN BE REMOVED -->
