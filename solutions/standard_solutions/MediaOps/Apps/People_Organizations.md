## People
People can be created to store administrative data on individuals that are relevant to your operations, such as operators, management, contractors, and customers. This data includes contact details, skills and experience information. People added in this app can be used in other DataMiner applications:
* As contact persons that can be linked to a Job in the Scheduling app 
* As bookable resources in the Resource Studio, Scheduling and Workflow apps

The P&O app allows to define a list of Skills, that can be assigned to people. These Skills appear as capabilities on the associated resources, making it easy to find the right person for a Job.

## Organizations
An organization represents a company in your supply chain, such as customers, suppliers or partners. Each person added to the People & Organizations app can be part of up to one Organization. The organizations created here can be used in the Scheduling app for the Organization field on a Job, which can for example be used to specify for which external or internal customer a Job is being carried out. 

## Teams
Teams are used to group together a smaller number of people. After creating a Team, users can add People to it and assign them a role in the team, like 'member', 'supervisor' etc. People can be part of multiple teams at the same time.
Teams can be converted into pools of bookable people resources that will show up in the Resource Studio, Scheduling and Workflow Designer apps. People from different organizations can be part of the same team.
