## People
People can be created to store administrative data on persons that are relevant in your operation, such as operators, management, contractors, customers, ... The stored administrative data includes for example contact details, skills and org chart information. The People that are created in the People & Organizations app will show up in different places throughout other DataMiner apps:
* As contact persons that can be linked to a Job in the Scheduling app 
* As bookable resources in the Resource Studio, Scheduling and Workflow apps

The P&O app also allows to define a list of Skills, that can then be assigned to people. These Skills will show up on the resources created for these people, allowing to easily match the right person to a task for users scheduling Jobs.


## Organizations
An organization represents a company in your supply chain, like customers, suppliers or partners. Every person created in the People & Organizations app can be part of up to one Organization. The organizations created here can be used in the Scheduling app for the customer field on a Job.

## Teams
Teams are used to group together a smaller number of people. After creating a Team, users can add People to it and assign them a role in the team, like 'member', 'supervisor' etc. People can be part of multiple teams at the same time.
Teams can be converted into pools of bookable people resources that will show up in the Resource Studio, Scheduling and Workflow Designer apps. People from different organizations can be part of the same team.
