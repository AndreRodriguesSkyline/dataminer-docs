# Linking Resource Pools  

The Resource Studio app allows you to link a resource pool to other pools. When a resource from a linked pool is added to a job, the system automatically adds resources from its linked pools as well. The same applies when adding a pool to a workflow in the Workflow Designer app.  

This feature ensures that all necessary resources are included when creating a job. For example, a pool of **OB trucks** could be linked to a **pool of truck drivers**â€”so when a truck is added to a job, the system automatically assigns a driver as well.  

There are two ways to handle resource selection when linking pools:  

1. Automatic Selection

   - When a pool (or one of its resources) is added to a job, the system **automatically selects** an available resource from the linked pool for the entire job duration. 
   - If no resources in the linked pool are available for the full duration, the system adds the **entire linked resource pool** instead. The user must then ensure a resource is available and swap it into the job when needed.  
   - When a pool or one of its resources is added to a workflow, a **pool node** is added to the workflow, with the option `Auto-select resource at job creation` set to `true`.  

1. Manual Selection

   - When a pool or one of its resources is added to a job, the system adds the linked resource pool to the job, allowing the user to manually select a specific resource later.  
   - When a pool or one of its resources is added to a workflow, a **pool node** is added to the workflow, with the option `Auto-select resource at job creation` set to `false`.
