# Editing a job

Jobs can be edited through the Edit Job panel. This panel can be accessed from the **job view**, **resource view**, **Ops Board** or **Search Jobs** pages, through the ðŸ–‰ icon. On top of the Edit Job panel the current state of the job is indicated and what states will follow under normal circumstances. The panel contains sections which are described below.

- **Job info**: Contains the general information (e.g. Name, Description, start, end) of the job and based on the [state of the job](xref:MO_S_Job_States) different buttons will be shown:
  - **Save as Tentative** (Draft): Move the job from Draft to a tentative state which will reserve all resources.
  - **Edit job config** (Draft, Tentative, Confirmed): some buttons to change the state of the job or to access the [profile configuration](xref:MO_S_Configuration) of the job itself. The configuration for the nodes can be accessed from both the Nodes and Workflow section.
  - **Confirm job** (Tentative): Move the job from Tentative to confirmed. Once the job is confirmed, the orchestration script will be executed.
  - **Cancel job** (Tentative, Confirmed): To cancel the job and to free up the resources again.
  - **Manual start** (Confirmed): When the event needs to start immediately, you can use this action to move the start time to now. This will change the job state to running.
  - **Stop early** (Running): When the event needs to stop immediately, you can use this action to trigger the stop actions. This will change the job state to Confirmed.
- **Related**: Contains all related/linked objects to the job. New links can be added by clicking the 'Add Link' button. New types can be added from the [App Configuration](xref:MO_S_App_Configuration) page.
- **Administration**: This section provides information to which organization the job can be billed. The billing depends on the contract selected.
- **Nodes**: Provides a list view of all nodes in the job. Resources or resource pools can be added from this section through the 'Add Resource' button.
- **Workflow**: Provides a workflow diagram of all nodes. Nodes and connection between them can be managed from this view.
