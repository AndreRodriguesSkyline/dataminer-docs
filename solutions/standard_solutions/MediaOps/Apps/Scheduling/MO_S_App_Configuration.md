# Configuring the app settings

On the *App Configuration* page, you can configure several app-wide settings:

- **Configure Default Pre- and Post-Roll**: To reserve a fixed amount of time for the equipment setup before a job starts and the time for the equipment dismantling after a job ends, you can click this button to define **pre-roll** and **post-roll** parameters across the whole app. This way, by default, the resources will be reserved for some time before the job begins and after it ends.

- **Configure Job ID**: Each job will have, apart from its name, a job ID, which can be used to uniquely identify the job, since the job names are not unique. Via this button, you can configure the **job ID pattern** that will be used in all the newly created jobs.

- **Configure System Properties**: This button allows you to define **additional metadata** to use in your jobs. These properties will not affect any logic in the MediaOps apps; they are metadata intended purely as additional information for users. To make it easier to order those properties, you can divide them into sections.<!-- RN 43041 -->

- **Reference Types**: If you want your jobs to be able to reference internal MediaOps entities or external generic entities, you can define the additional entities in this section. The references are very generic, enabling you to reference a vast array of different types of entities.
