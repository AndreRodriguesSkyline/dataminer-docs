# Workflow Designer

The workflow designer app allows you to manage and configure Workflows. A workflow describes what resources are needed and how they are interconnected. Workflows can be used as templates for Jobs in the [Scheduling app](xref:MO_Scheduling).

The main features of the app:

- Manage workflows by define which workflows are currently available (Complete) for job creation.

- Define the resources needed for the workflow and how the resources are linked to each other.

- Provide default configuration settings for certain resources (e.g. required capacities).

- Define a custom workflow execution script.

More details on creating workflows can be found [here](xref:WFD_Creating_Workflows).
