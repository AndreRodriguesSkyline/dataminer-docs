# Workflow Designer

The workflow designer app allows you to manage and configure all workflows. Workflows can be seen as templates for jobs that can be created from the [Scheduling app](xref:MO_Scheduling).

A workflow can be in one of the following states:

- **Draft**: In this stage the workflow is not (yet) available to be used as template for the creation of jobs.
- **Complete**: In this stage the resource pool is considered complete and can be used to create workflows and jobs.
- **Obsolete**: TBC WITH THE TEAM WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHY NOT DEPRECATED AS IN OTHER OBJECTS? => HAS TO BE DEPRECATED
- **Error**: TBC WITH THE TEAM IF IT CAN BE REMOVED

The following pages are available in the app:

- [*Home*](#home)
- [*About*](#about)

## Home

The Home page allows you to manage all workflows. On creation of the workflow you will be prompted with to provide values for the general fields of the workflow. More information on the fields can be found HERE TODO. Once you have a workflow created you can start building the workflow with the buttons above the 'Selected workflow' section.
