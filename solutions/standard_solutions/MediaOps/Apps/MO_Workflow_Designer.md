# Workflow Designer

The workflow designer app allows you to manage and configure Workflows. They describe a set of resources and how they are interconnected. These workflows can then be used as templates for Jobs that can be created from the [Scheduling app](xref:MO_Scheduling).


The main actions that users can do in the app include:

- Adding nodes to a workflow. When a user creates a new workflow, the first thing they will typically do is add nodes representing the different types of resources that will contribute to the execution of the workflow.

- Defining booking behavior. When workflows get executed, users can opt to create bookings on the nodes in the workflow or not.

- Creating connections between nodes. The workflow designer allows users to define connectivity between nodes that need to have a network connection set up between them for the execution of the workflow.

- Describing what should happen when a workflow gets executed.


More details on creating workflows can be found [here](xref:WFD_Creating_Workflows).
