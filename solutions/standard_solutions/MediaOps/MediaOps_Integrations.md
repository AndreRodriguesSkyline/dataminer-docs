# Integration Notes

## Customizing the visualization

When building your own custom applications on top of MediaOps, we advise to always use the [xxx NuGet package](https://todo.be) to interact with MediaOps. This will ensure that your custom applications keeps on working when upgrading to the next version of MediaOps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We don't guarantee that duplicates of the apps remain compatible with newer versions of MediaOps. The ad-hoc data sources that are part of the solution can change in the future and hence break anything using those ad-hoc data sources.
