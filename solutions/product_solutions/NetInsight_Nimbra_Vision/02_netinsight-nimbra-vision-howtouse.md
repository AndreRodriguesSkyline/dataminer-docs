# Using the NetInsight Nimbra Vision App

The DataMiner Nimbra Vision solution provides comprehensive monitoring and orchestration of Nimbra Nodes from a single pane of glass. This seamless end-to-end monitoring and orchestration is made possible through its integration with the Nimbra Vision platform. The app has multiple pages and panels, which are presented below.

## Scheduled Services

Provides a easy way to user to monitor and manage scheduled circuit/services in Nimbra network. The list of circuit are displayed in a table and timeline view. From the table, users can also open a node edge view to provide a user friendly way to visualize the end-to-end network connections.

The page header offers quick access to schedule *J2K* and *E-Line* services. A *Plan Circuit* button is also available at the top-right. Such button opens a pop-up which allows the user to select the preferred service type, capacity, interfaces, start and end times.

### Adhoc Services

Users can easily connect/disconnect interfaces by creating/decommissioning services of the supported types. At time of this writing, the solution supports E-Line and J2K service types. The *connect* option triggers the start of the circuit at the time of the click and run indefinitely. JXS and SRT services are currently being being implemented and will be supported in an upcomming version.

## Monitoring
Users gain an overview of the Nimbra nodes orchestrated by Nimbra Vision, allowing them to easily monitor the state of interfaces on these nodes and track any active alarms.

## Nimbra Interfaces
Users can inspect the network interfaces of the Nimbra nodes, identifying their status as well as current and historical transmission rates.

## Network Overview
Users are provided with a node-edge component that offers a visual overview of Nimbra's network topology.
