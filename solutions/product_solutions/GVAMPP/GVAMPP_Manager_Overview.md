# Grass Valley AMPP Manager application

The Grass Valley Agile Media Processing Platform (GV AMPP) Manager application package offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling workloads and snapshots.

After [deploying the package](xref:GVAMPP_Manager_Installing) from the DataMiner Catalog, a low-code app becomes available on the DataMiner landing page (`https://[DMA]/root/`). This app allows users to select any existing GV AMPP Manager (a connector also installed in the package) and immediately access key metrics, statistics, and control options.
