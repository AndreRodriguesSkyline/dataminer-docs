# CI/CD tutorials

CI/CD, also known as [continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment](xref:CICD), allows teams to deliver software more quickly, with higher quality and reliability, by automating the build, test, and deployment process.

Different technology stacks, such as [Azure](xref:CICD_Azure_DevOps_Examples), [Concourse](xref:CICD_Concourse_Examples), [GitHub](xref:CICD_GitHub_Examples), [GitLab](xref:CICD_GitLab_Examples), and [Jenkins](xref:CICD_Jenkins_Examples), are used to handle CI/CD, which is why Skyline Communications provides additional tooling and libraries that can run any of these. See also: [Platform-independent CI/CD](xref:Platform_independent_CICD).

You can also run our tooling through [command line](xref:CICD_Command_Line_Examples) on both Windows and Ubuntu.
