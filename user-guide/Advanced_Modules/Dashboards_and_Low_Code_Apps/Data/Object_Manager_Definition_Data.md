# Object manager definition data

The *Object manager definitions* data category allows you to use data from [DOM definitions](xref:DomDefinition) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Object manager definitions* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available DOM definitions is displayed.

To quickly find a specific DOM definition, use the filter box at the top of the data section.
