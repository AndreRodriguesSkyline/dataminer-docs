# Object manager instance data

The *Object manager instance* data category allows you to use data from [DOM instances](xref:DomInstance) in your DataMiner System as input for components in your dashboards or low-code apps.

When you expand the *Indices* section in the *Data* pane, you first need to select a DOM module from the dropdown list. Once a module is selected, all available DOM instances for that module are listed. To find a specific DOM instance, you can scroll through the list or use the search field.

When you expand the *Object manager instances* section in the *Data* pane, a list of all available DOM instances is displayed.

To quickly find a specific DOM instance, use the filter box at the top of the data section.
