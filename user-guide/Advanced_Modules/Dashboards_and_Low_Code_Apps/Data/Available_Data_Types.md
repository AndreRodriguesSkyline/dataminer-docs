# Available data types

When you configure a component in a dashboard or low-code app, you need to combine a visualization with data.

The type of data you select determines what kind of information the component can show and where that information comes from, e.g. data passed from another component or real-time values from an element, service, view, etc.

When editing a dashboard or app, all available data types are listed in the *Data* pane under *All available data*. Depending on the selected visualization, only compatible data types can be used. Some visualizations require a specific type of data, while others support multiple types.
