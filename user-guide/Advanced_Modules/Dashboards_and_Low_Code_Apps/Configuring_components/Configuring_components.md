# Configuring components

Each dashboard or low-code app component consists of **a visualization and data**.

In the edit mode, visualizations are available via the panel on the left, and data is available via the *Data* pane on the right.

There are several ways to add a component:

- **Drag a visualization** from the pane on the left onto an empty section of the dashboard or low-code app page (1). Data will then need to be added to the component (2).

- **Drag data** from the *Data* pane on the right onto an empty section of the dashboard or low-code app page (1). A visualization will then still need to be applied to the component (2).

The following actions are then possible to configure the component:

- [Applying a visualization](xref:Apply_Visualization)

- [Adding data to a component](xref:Adding_data_to_component)

- [Customizing the component layout](xref:Customize_Component_Layout)

- [Using the Template Editor](xref:Template_Editor)

- [Deleting a component](xref:Delete_Component)

In addition, depending on the visualization, additional configuration options may be available. For more information, refer to the relevant section in [Available visualizations](xref:Available_visualizations), or click the component or hover the mouse pointer over the component and click the ![information](~/user-guide/images/Information_Icon.png) icon (available from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.2 onwards<!--RN 38224-->).
