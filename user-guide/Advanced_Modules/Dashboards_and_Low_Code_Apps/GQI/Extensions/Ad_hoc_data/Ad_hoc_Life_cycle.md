# Life cycle of ad hoc data sources

Whenever an ad hoc data source is used, an instance of the associated C# class is created and GQI will call the relevant life cycle methods that define its behavior.

The following simplified diagram shows in what order each GQI life cycle method is called.

> [!NOTE]
> In practice, the life cycle methods that will be called depend on a various conditions. See the [detailed life cycle overview](#detailed-life-cycle-overview) for a complete overview.

## When is an ad hoc data source instance created?

A new ad hoc data source instance is created *every time* one of the following requests occur:

1. A **capability request**: used to determine the query arguments used in the query builder.
1. A **columns request**: used to determine which columns are available without fetching any data.
1. A **new session request**: used to retrieve the actual data from an ad hoc data source

The type of request also determines which life cycle methods are used.

## Detailed life cycle overview

The following life cycle methods exist for ad hoc data sources:

| Method | Interface | Required | Availablity |
|--|--|--|--|
| [OnInit](#oninit) | [IGQIOnInit](xref:GQI_IGQIOnInit) | No | Always |
| [GetInputArguments](#getinputarguments) | [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments) | No | Always |
| [OnArgumentsProcessed](#onargumentsprocessed) | [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments) | No | Always |
| [GetColumns](#getcolumns) | [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource) | Yes | Always |
| [Optimize](#optimize) | [IGQIOptimizableDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIOptimizableDataSource) | No | From DataMiner 10.5.0 [CU2]/10.5.5 onwards when using the [GQI DxM](xref:GQI_DxM)<!-- RN42528 --> |
| [OnPrepareFetch](#onpreparefetch) | [IGQIOnPrepareFetch](xref:GQI_IGQIOnPrepareFetch) | No | Always |
| [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) | [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable) | No | From DataMiner 10.4.4/10.5.0 onwards<!-- RN 38643 --> |
| [GetNextPage](#getnextpage) | [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource) | Yes | Always |
| [OnStopUpdates](#onstopupdates) | [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable) | No | From DataMiner 10.4.4/10.5.0 onwards<!-- RN 38643 --> |
| [OnDestroy](#ondestroy) | [IGQIOnDestroy](xref:GQI_IGQIOnDestroy) | No | Always |

The life cycle methods that are called on an ad hoc data source instance depend on the following conditions:

- The [interfaces](xref:Ad_hoc_Building_blocks) that are implemented by the associated C# class
- The type of GQI request for which the instance was [created](#when-is-an-ad-hoc-data-source-instance-created)
- The operators used in the query
- The query options provided by the client (e.g. whether updates are enabled)
- The result of previous life cycle methods

The following diagram shows a complete overview of all possible life cycle paths.

![Ad hoc data source life cycle](~/user-guide/images/GQI_AdHocDataSourceLifeCycle2.png)

### OnInit

Building block interface: [IGQIOnInit](xref:GQI_IGQIOnInit)

If implemented, `OnInit` is always the first life cycle method. It can provide references to dependencies like a logger or an SLNet connection and can be used to initialize resources that should be available during the lifetime of the ad hoc data source instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resources that are initialized here should be cleaned up in the final [OnDestroy](#ondestroy) life cycle method.

> [!TIP]
> When resources are only required for specific requests, the initialization should be done in later life cycle methods to avoid unnecessary resource allocations:
>
> - For resources that are only needed to support real-time updates, use the [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) life cycle method.
> - For resources that are only needed to fetch data, use the [OnPrepareFetch](#onpreparefetch) life cycle method.
> - For resources that are only needed to determine columns, use the [GetColumns](#getcolumns) life cycle method.

### GetInputArguments

Building block interface: [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments)

If implemented, the `GetInputArguments` defines the arguments that can be used to configure the ad hoc data source in a query.

Later, the arguments defined here will determine which argument values are available in the [OnArgumentsProcessed](#onargumentsprocessed) life cycle method.

### OnArgumentsProcessed

Building block interface: [IGQIInputArguments](xref:GQI_IGQIInputArguments)

If implemented, the `OnArgumentsProcessed` method gives access to the values of the arguments defined in the [GetInputArguments](#getinputarguments) life cycle method that were specified in the query.

### GetColumns

Building block interface: [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource)

The `GetColumns` life cycle method defines the name and type of the columns that are available in the ad hoc data source.

### Optimize

Building block interface: [IGQIOptimizableDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIOptimizableDataSource)

If implemented, the `Optimize` life cycle method allows the ad hoc data source to interpret operators that are applied immediately after the data source and potentially adjust its behavior to achieve more performant data retrieval.

This life cycle method can be called multiple times for the same instance when the ad hoc data source optimizes the previously applied operator away.

### OnPrepareFetch

Building block interface: [IGQIOnPrepareFetch](xref:GQI_IGQIOnPrepareFetch)

If implemented, the `OnPrepareFetch` life cycle method allows the ad hoc data source instance to initialize resources that are only needed when fetching data.

If resources are initialized in this method, they should be cleaned up in the final [OnDestroy](#ondestroy) life cycle method.

### OnStartUpdates

Building block interface: [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable)

If implemented, the `OnStartUpdates` life cycle method is only called when updates are enabled in the query options. It allows the ad hoc data source instance to initialize any resources that are required to support real-time updates such as subscriptions and event handlers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resources that are initialized here should be cleaned up in the [OnStopUpdates](#onstopupdates) life cycle method.

### GetNextPage

Building block interface: [IGQIDataSource](xref:GQI_IGQIDataSource)

The `GetNextPage` life cycle method defines the actual data for the ad hoc data source instance. It will be called at least once, and can subsequently be called again multiple times as long as the previous GetNextPage call indicates that more pages are available.

### OnStopUpdates

Building block interface: [IGQIUpdateable](xref:GQI_IGQIUpdateable)

If implemented, the `OnStopUpdates` life cycle method is only called when updates were enabled in the query options. It allows the ad hoc data source instance to clean up any resources that were initialized in the [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) life cycle method to support real-time updates.

> [!WARNING]
> The `OnStopUpdates` life cycle method will **not** be called when the [OnStartUpdates](#onstartupdates) life cycle method failed.

### OnDestroy

Building block interface: [IGQIOnDestroy](xref:GQI_IGQIOnDestroy)

If implemented, `OnDestroy` is always the last life cycle method. It allows you to clean up any resources that were used during the life time of the ad hoc data source instance.

> [!WARNING]
> The `OnDestroy` life cycle method will **not** be called when the [OnInit](#oninit) life cycle method failed.
