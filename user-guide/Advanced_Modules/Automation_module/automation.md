# About DataMiner Automation

*Your open DevOps tools of choice.*

The DataMiner Automation engine performs all automation tasks in the ecosystem. Its pronounced **open architecture** enables operators to easily create scripts and customize script behavior to their specific environment whenever needed.

Even if tasks are automated, the operator always remains in control. Not only is there a full audit trail of the executed tasks, but operators can also opt to **interact with the Automation engine at runtime**. DataMiner interactive Automation scripts can be set up to prompt for operator input, which is then used to automate further actions.

Automation scripts can be **developed, tested, and deployed at runtime**. Using built-in version control and quality checks during deployment (with [DataMiner Integration Studio](xref:Overall_concept_of_the_DataMiner_Integration_Studio) and CI/CD using our [dedicated workflows](xref:github_reusable_workflows_automation_master_workflow)), operators can easily use DevOps practices to respond to the ever-increasing dynamic and rapid changes in todayâ€™s networks, data centers, and service offerings.

With the **DataMiner Automation module in Cube**, you can [manage](xref:Managing_Automation_scripts) and [design scripts](xref:Designing_Automation_scripts) that can automatically take care of backup routines, system configuration, channel selection, report generation, notifications via email or SMS, and much more. Within the user interface, you can build intricate, nested scripts that can then be scheduled for one-off or repeated execution. They can also be [linked to objects shown in Microsoft Visio drawings](xref:Linking_a_shape_to_an_Automation_script), so that operators can trigger them with a click of a button.
