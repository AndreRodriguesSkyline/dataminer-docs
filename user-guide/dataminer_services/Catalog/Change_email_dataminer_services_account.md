## Ensuring continued access to services and data

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions below are organized by service/feature. Please note that not all instructions may be applicable to your specific usage.

### Access to dataminer.services features

If your dataminer.services account was previously given access to dataminer.services features for an organization via the **Admin app**, this will need to be done again for the new dataminer.services account.

**How?** See `[Managing dataminer.services users](xref:Managing_dataminer_services_users)`.

### DataMiner account linkage
If your dataminer.services account was previously linked to your DataMiner account, you need to do the same with your new dataminer.services account.

**How?** See `[Linking your DataMiner account to your dataminer.services account](xref:Linking_your_DataMiner_and_dataminer_services_account)`.

### Access to projects via Collaboration App

To maintain access to your projects and tasks via the Collaboration app, your new dataminer.services account will need to be linked to your verified organization.

### Data on DataMiner Community (Dojo)

Upon logging into Dojo with your new account, you will notice that a new account has been created. You may request to transfer data from your former account to the new one at any time. If you opt for the transfer, your old account will be deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this action can only be performed by Skyline staff upon request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some limitations apply to what kind of data can be transferred:
>  - Any progress you have made on courses and quizzes in the [Learning module](https://community.dataminer.services/learning/) is non-transferable and will be lost, so you will need to start over in this module.
>  - Any comments you have made in the [Questions module](https://community.dataminer.services/questions/) will still be displayed as posted with your former account.

**How?** After you logged into [community.dataminer.services](https://community.dataminer.services/) with your new account, please contact [back.office@skyline.be](mailto:back.office@skyline.be?subject=Request%20to%20transfer%20my%20DataMiner%20Dojo%20data&body=Hi%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20transfer%20my%20DataMiner%20Dojo%20data.%0D%0AThe%20accounts%20involved%20are%20listed%20below%3A%0D%0A%0D%0AFrom%3A%0D%0A%3Cfill%20in%20email%20address%3E%0D%0A%0D%0ATo%20(new%20account)%3A%0D%0A%3Cfill%20in%20email%20address%3E%0D%0A) to request to transfer your existing data. You will need to confirm before the transfer due to the aforementioned limitations.
