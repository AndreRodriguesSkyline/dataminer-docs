# Creating a Job

There are three main ways to manually create a new Job through the scheduling app:
- From scratch
- Starting from a predefined workflow
- By selecting a resource

## From scratch

The first way to create a new Job is by clicking the 'New' button on the 'Job View' page of the application. This will open a pop-up asking the user to enter a name and a start and end time for the new Job. By default, the timings will be set to a duration of one hour starting now. This will create an empty Job, without any resource in it yet. Once the job has been created, it will appear on the schedule in a Draft state. The user can then start adding resources to it from the [Job edit panel](xref:SCH_Edit_Job) by clicking the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the Job on the timeline.

## Starting from a predefined workflow

It's also possible to create a Job start from a workflow that has been predefined in the [Workflow Designer](xref:MO_Workflow_Designer) app. This is done similarly to creating a Job from scratch, but instead selecting the desired workflow from the dropdown in the 'Create job' pop-up. 

 > [!NOTE]
> Only workflows that have been marked as 'Complete' in the Workflow Designer will appear for selection in the Scheduling app.
