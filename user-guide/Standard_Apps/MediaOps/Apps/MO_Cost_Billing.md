# Cost & Billing

The Cost & Billing app allows you to manage and configure the costs and the billing for resources. The cost is defined on resource level. Therefor it will be the same for all jobs using the same resource. The billing depends on the organization linked to the job. For every organization you can define different billing. TBD

The following pages are available in the app:

- [*Contracts*](#contracts)
- [*Ratecards*](#ratecards)
- [*Currencies*](#currencies)
- [*Financials*](#financials)
- [*About*](#about)

## Contracts

The Contracts page provides three subpages:

- **Overview** provides a statistical overview of all contracts
- **List** provides a list view of all contracts
- **Schedule** provides a timeline view to visualize the validity period of the contracts

New contracts can be made from both the Overview and the List view. However, not all fields can be configured from the form to create a new contract. From the List view where the most right columns are clickable, it is possible to configure the organizations for which this contract is valid, the default workflow and resource ratecards, custom ratecards for specific pools, resources or workflows. More detailed information can be found under [Contracts](xref:MO_CB_Contracts).

## Ratecards

There are two types of ratecards:

- **Cost RCs** define the cost
- **Billing RCs** define how billing needs to be done to the user

The Ratecards page provides five subpages:

- **Overview** provides a statistical overview of all ratecards
- **List** provides a list view of all ratecards
- **Workflow RCs** provides a list of all ratecards that have been assigned to specific workflows
- **Pool RCs** provides a list of all ratecards that have been assigned to specific resource pools
- **Resource RCs** provides a list of all ratecards that have been assigned to specific resources

More detailed information on how to create ratecards can be found under [Ratecards](xref:MO_CB_Ratecards).

## Currencies

Multiple currencies are supported => TODO ASK WHY WE HAVE TO DEFINE THE CONVERSION RATE IN THE APP?

## Financials

TBD

## About

The About page provides information on the version of MediaOps package.
