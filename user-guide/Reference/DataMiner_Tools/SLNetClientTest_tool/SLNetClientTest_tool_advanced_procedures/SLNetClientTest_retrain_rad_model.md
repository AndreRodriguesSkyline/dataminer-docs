# Retraining the internal model used by RAD

In some cases, it can be useful to retrain the internal model used by [relational anomaly detection (RAD)](xref:Relational_anomaly_detection). This allows you to indicate the periods during which a parameter group was behaving as expected, so that RAD can better identify when the parameters deviate from that expected behavior in the future.

1. [Connect to the DMA hosting the grouped parameters using the SLNetClientTest tool](xref:Connecting_to_a_DMA_with_the_SLNetClientTest_tool).

1. Go to the *Build Message* tab of the main window of the SLNetCLientTest tool.

1. In the *Message Type* drop-down list, select the message *Skyline.DataMiner.Analytics.MAD.RetrainMADModelMessage*.

   In this message, "MAD" stands for "multivariate anomaly detection", which is another name for RAD.

1. Configure the following fields:

   - *GroupName*: The name of the parameter group as configured in *RelationalAnomalyDetection.xml*.
   - *StartTime*: The start time of the period during which the parameter group was behaving as expected.
   - *EndTime*: The end time of the period during which the parameter group was behaving as expected.

1. Click *Send Message*.

> [!NOTE]

> - From DataMiner 10.5.2/10.6.0 onwards, other messages are also available that can be used to add a parameter group, retrieve a parameter group, or retrieve all configuration information for a particular group (*AddMADParameterGroupMessage*, *RemoveMADParameterGroupMessage*, and *GetMADParameterGroupInfoMessage*, respectively). While you can configure and view the same things directly in *RelationalAnomalyDetection.xml*, with these messages you can for example configure a [low-code app](xref:Application_framework) to visualize and manage the parameter groups.<!-- RN 42181 -->
> - Keep in mind that the group names need to be unique. Prior to DataMiner 10.5.4/10.6.0, casing is taken into account for this, but this no longer matters in later DataMiner versions.<!-- RN 42276 -->
