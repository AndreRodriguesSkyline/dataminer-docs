# Viewing user information

To view detailed information on a user:

1. In the *Users / Groups* section of the System Center module, go to the *users* tab, and select the user whose information you want to view.

1. In the details pane on the right:

   - Check the *Details* tab to view the user’s contact details, security level, dataminer.services username and last login.

   - Check the *Group membership* tab to view what group(s) the user is a member of.

   - Check the *Permissions* tab to view what permissions have been configured for the user.

     > [!NOTE]
     > User permissions are inherited from the user group. To edit these, you need to edit the group.

   - Check the *Alerts* tab to view what notifications have been configured for the user.

   - Check the *Activity* tab to view a log of the user’s recent activity. This tab consists of two pages:

     - The *Recent sessions* page shows when the user has recently logged on, and what client application was used.

     - The *Actions* page shows a detailed overview of all recent activity of the user on the DMA.

> [!NOTE]
> You can view the same information on a user card. For more information on how to open a user card, see [Opening a user card](xref:Opening_a_user_card).
