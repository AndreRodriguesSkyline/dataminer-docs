# Adding a DataMiner Agent to a DMS running STaaS

To add a DataMiner Agent to a DMS running STaaS:

1. Make sure that the DMA you are adding is a clean DMA, meaning that it is a newly installed DMA or a DMA that has been [fully reset](xref:Factory_reset_tool).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If the CloudGateway DxM is installed on the DMA you are adding, the data folder `C:\ProgramData\Skyline Communications\DataMiner CloudGateway\Data` must be empty.

1. Stop the DMA that will be added.

1. On the DMA that will be added, stop CloudGateway if it is installed.

1. On the DMA that will be added, stop both the NAS and NATS services.

1. Go to the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\` folder of an existing DMA in the cluster, and follow the steps below:

   1. Copy the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\NATS\nsc` folder and place it in the same location on the new DMA.

   1. Copy the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\SLCloud.xml` file to the same location on the new DMA.

1. Configure the new DMA:

   1. Open `C:\Skyline DataMiner\SLCloud.xml` and modify the `<ClientID>` to match the name of the server.

   1. Open `C:\Skyline DataMiner\MaintenanceSettings.xml` and add the following tag under the `<SLNet>` section:

      ```xml
      <NATSForceManualConfig>true</NATSForceManualConfig>
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > This will temporarily disable automatic NATS configuration. Make sure to follow all steps in the procedure below so that automatic NATS configuration is enabled again later.

   1. Configure *DB.xml* with STaaS:

      1. In the `C:\Skyline DataMiner` folder, open *DB.xml*.

      1. Configure the *Database* tag with *type="CloudStorage"* as illustrated below:

         ```xml
         <?xml version="1.0"?>
         <DataBases xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/config/db">
            <DataBase active="true" local="true" search="true" cloud="true" type="CloudStorage"/>
         </DataBases>
         ```

1. Start the new DMA.

1. Join the DMA to the cluster using the steps described under [Adding a regular DataMiner Agent](xref:Adding_a_regular_DataMiner_Agent) or [Failover configuration in Cube](xref:Failover_configuration_in_Cube) for a Failover Agent.

1. Open `C:\Skyline DataMiner\MaintenanceSettings.xml` on the newly added DMA and remove the `<NATSForceManualConfig>` tag.

1. Restart the newly added DMA.

1. Start CloudGateway on the newly added DMA if it is installed.

The DMA should now be connected to the DMS running STaaS.
