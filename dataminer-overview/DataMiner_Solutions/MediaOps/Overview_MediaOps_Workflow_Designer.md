# Workflow Designer app

The Workflow Designer has a central role in dataminer.MediaOps. It allows media engineers to define the technical workflows that are made available for both ad hoc and scheduled operations.

The main actions that users can do in the app include:

- Adding nodes to a workflow. When a user creates a new workflow, the first thing they will typically do is add nodes representing the different actors that will contribute to the execution of the workflow.

- Defining **booking behavior**. When workflows get executed, users can opt to create bookings on the nodes in the workflow.

- Creating connections between nodes. The workflow designer allows users to define connectivity between nodes that need to have a network connection set up between them for the execution of the workflow.

- Describing what should happen when a workflow gets executed.

- Specifying **monitoring settings**.
