# Resource Studio app

The Resource Studio app is used to quickly create and manage an inventory of bookable resources. This includes both resources tied to elements in the DataMiner System and resources that are not managed by DataMiner.

This app allows users to:

- **Create and manage various types of resources**, including network inventory, services, and other things with limited availability such as people, rooms, vehicles, etc.

- **Organize resources into pools** for easier management and selection.

- **Describe capabilities** of resources or pools, for easier resource selection for workflows and jobs.

- **Manage concurrency and capacity of resources**.

- **Attach metadata to resources** to store additional information relevant to resources as properties.
