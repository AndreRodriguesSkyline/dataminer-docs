# Expectations
Recommended and focus skill sets are not prerequisites. After all, we live in an ever faster evolving technology landscape where **continuous learning is the new normal**. Therefore, passion and the ability to absorb new knowledge prevail over the existing skill sets of a candidate.

Of course, it is equally essential to ensure that you set up a **continuous learning program** for the DataMiner DevOps Professionals, to evolve their existing skill sets as well as to acquire new ones. These skill sets can both relate to DataMiner itself and to other associated skills.

## Skill sets to consider

When considering becoming a DataMiner DevOps Professional, or when you are setting up a team of DataMiner DevOps Professionals as an organization, system integrator, or consultancy house, you can wonder about the skill sets that would be required.

**New world mindset**
Knowledge of and experience with agile methodologies, value delivery, objectives and key results, continuous learning, being community-oriented, empowering people, etc.

**Domain knowledge & expertise**
Knowledge of and experience within your specific vertical (e.g. satellite, OTT, contribution, data centers, media, energy, HFC, security, IP, cloud, IoT, etc.)

**General ICT concepts & architecture knowledge**
Knowledge of and experience with general concepts and technology related to CI/CD, automation and orchestration, process modeling, object modeling, IP networking, KQI engineering, coding, actionable insights, unit testing, data storage, cloud, etc.

**DataMiner knowledge & expertise**
Knowledge of and expertise in leveraging DataMiner, which could be focused on specific areas such as data ingest, resource control, digital twin modeling, automation and orchestration, process automation, user experience and control surface design, etc.

## Setting up a continuous learning program
Recommended and focus skill sets are not prerequisites. After all, we live in an ever faster evolving technology landscape where continuous learning is the new normal. Therefore, passion and the ability to absorb new knowledge are prevailing over the existing skill set of a candidate.

Of course, it is equally essential to ensure that you set up a continuous learning program for the DataMiner DevOps Professionals, to evolve their existing skill sets as well as to acquire new ones. These skill sets can both relate to DataMiner itself and to other associated skills.

Skill sets should not necessarily be achieved through a single individual, but rather by a team. In a typical organization, you are looking at setting up an autonomous squad of up to maximum 8 individuals, workings towards well-defined goals. Hence, skill sets can also be considered at squad level.

They can also be quite broad if considered in a more generalized context and only become larger by the day. Therefore, it is also important to consider and prioritize the skills that apply most to your business, your operation, your existing teams, your strategy and goals, etc. 

The spectrum of so-called ICT and software skills is continuously expanding. No longer does this solely revolve around software coding and scripting. And although the latter is still part of the overall skill set (attributed to the team), technology evolutions such as no-code development and data-engineering tools, just to name some, have broadened the number of people that can be considered candidates to strengthen your DataMiner DevOps Professionals team.

## When joining the program, do it the right way

Becoming a DataMiner DevOps Professional, or setting up a team of DataMiner DevOps Professionals, is a key strategic component for ambitious career furtherance, or to build a future-proof, data-driven operation.
