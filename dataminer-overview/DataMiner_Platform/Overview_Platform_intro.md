# DataMiner platform – empowering your digital transformation

DataMiner is a key enabling technology for your digital transformation.

The transitions nowadays are fundamentally different in nature compared to anything we experienced in the past decades. Today you are not simply moving an existing business and workflows to a new generation of technology. Instead, all-IP, virtualized, and cloudified products create endless possibilities to build and shape a business in many ways.

Today's new enabling technologies affect and change everything we are accustomed to in a business. That is why it is an important strategic goal to build an agile operation that is prepared for the unexpected and able to adapt and evolve quickly. Simply deploying all-IP or cloud-based technology will not magically launch an organization into the new era. How you use that transformational technology to empower your operations is what will make the difference.
