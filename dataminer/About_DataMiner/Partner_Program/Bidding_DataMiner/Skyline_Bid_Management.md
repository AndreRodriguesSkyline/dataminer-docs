# Skyline bid management

The tender workflow defines how opportunities are identified, evaluated, approved, submitted, and monitored.
It incorporates internal processes as well as partner-specific actions and responsibilities. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the workflow, clarify roles, and ensure alignment between all parties involved.

## Workflow

1. Tender Opportunity Identification: Identify or receive a tender opportunity through partner portal. Direct mail submission to be rejected in place of end partner portal submission.

1. Preliminary Evaluation: Assess eligibility, risks, and alignment with business strategy. Decide to proceed or decline (Go/No-Go).

1. Partner Notification & Coordination: Inform partners, align responsibilities, and schedule a kickoff meeting.

1. Tender Document Analysis: Review tender requirements, create a compliance matrix, and clarify doubts with the issuer.

1. Solution Design & Proposal Development: Prepare the technical solution, pricing, and required documentation in collaboration with partners.

1. Internal Review & Approval: Review the full proposal internallyâ€”legal, financial, and commercial approval required.

1. Partner Review & Final Alignment: Share draft with partners, incorporate feedback, and finalize submission materials.

1. Tender Submission: Submit the final tender response via the designated method (portal, email, etc.).

1. Post-Submission Monitoring: Track progress, respond to clarifications, and maintain communication with partners.

1. Award Notification & Next Steps: Communicate results, initiate contract if awarded, or conduct a debrief if not.

## Timeline

Each cycle necessitates expert input to ensure optimal preparation prior to final submission. Accordingly, steps 1 through 8 generally require an average timeframe of 4 to 6 weeks to complete.

The bid management team at Skyline operate as efficiently as possible, timing may vary at different times in the year depending on volume of active tenders.
