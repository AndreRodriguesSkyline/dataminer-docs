# Contents of Elements folder deleted from offline Agents in Failover cluster

## Affected versions

All Failover systems.

## Cause

This issue is triggered by a specific sequence of events:

1. A DVE parent element (with current or historical DVEs) is removed or migrated.

1. Because of a naming conflict in the cluster, an entry with only `<INVALID NAME>` is created in the DVE element info in the database.

1. This entry causes DataMiner to attempt to delete DVE child elements from the cluster.

1. On offline Agents, this results in the entire `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Elements` folder being deleted instead of just the specific DVEs.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This issue is more likely to occur if the `noElementPrefix` option is used, as this removes the parent element name from DVE names and increases the chance of name conflicts.
> - Entries in the database like `<INVALID NAME> element name` (i.e. also containing the element name in addition to `<INVALID NAME>`) do not trigger this issue.

## Fix

No fix is available yet.

## Workaround

1. Locate the element info:

   - Look for a zipped folder named `Element   deleted` in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Recycle Bin` folder, or

   - Copy the element files from the online DMA.

1. Copy the elements to the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Elements` folder of the offline DMA.

1. Restart the DMA.

## Description

On offline Agents in a Failover cluster, the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Elements` folder may be partially or fully emptied. In some cases, no elements remain.

To detect whether this has occurred:

- Compare the number of elements on the online and offline Agents.

- Check the offline Agentâ€™s Recycle Bin for entries named `Element   deleted`, indicating a deletion occurred without a known element name.
