#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: No error would be returned when a parameter or an element could not be fetched [ID 42584]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

When a component tried to fetch parameters or elements, up to now, null would be returned for every parameter or element that could not be found.

From now on, for every parameter or element than cannot be found, a clear error message will be returned. Each of those error messages will then explain why a particular parameter or element could not be found.
