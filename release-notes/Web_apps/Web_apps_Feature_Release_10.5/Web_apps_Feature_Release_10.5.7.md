### Enhancements

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Enhancements made to redesigned UI component 'StaticText' [ID 42662]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When the text in a redesigned `UIBlockType.StaticText` component does not fit the width of the component, it will automatically be ellipsed, and when you hover over the component, the full text will be displayed in a tooltip.

From now on, the text in a redesigned `UIBlockType.StaticText` will no longer be automatically ellipsed when it contains newline characters. In that case, similar to the legacy `UIBlockType.StaticText` component, the text will be split into multiple lines.

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Timeline component: Enhanced behavior of timeline items when panning [ID 42670]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, the behavior of timeline items has improved when panning.

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Enhancements made to redesigned UI component 'CheckBoxList' [ID 42826]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the redesigned `UIBlockType.CheckBoxList` component. Its behavior is now more in line with other redesigned components like the `UIBlockType.RadioButtonList` component.

Currently, by default, the existing components will still be used by default to keep the UI aligned. If you want to use the new components, then add the following argument to the URL of the low-code app:

`?useNewIASInputComponents=true`

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Enhancements made to dropdown controls [ID 42840]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

A number of minor enhancements have been made to the dropdown controls.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: No error would be returned when a parameter or an element could not be fetched [ID 42584]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When a component tried to fetch parameters or elements, up to now, null would be returned for every parameter or element that could not be found.

From now on, for every parameter or element than cannot be found, a clear error message will be returned. Each of those error messages will then explain why a particular parameter or element could not be found.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Node edge graph component: Moving a node would incorrectly cause the actions of that node to be executed [ID 42798]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When, in a node edge graph, you dragged a node to another position, up to now, the actions configured in that node would incorrectly be executed.

#### Web API: WebSocket connections would incorrectly not get closed when a client disconnected [ID 42848]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16] / 10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

In the web API, in some cases, WebSocket connections would incorrectly not get closed when a client disconnected. As a result, the web API would believe it was still connected to the client and would keep a connection to SLNet.

From now on, WebSocket connections will automatically get closed after 5 minutes of inactivity.

Also, a number of enhancements have been made with regard to error handling, especially when a connection gets closed.
