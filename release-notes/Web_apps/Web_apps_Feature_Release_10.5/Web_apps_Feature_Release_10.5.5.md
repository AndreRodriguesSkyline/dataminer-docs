## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Dropdown component: Enhanced behavior [ID 42298]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

Up to now, a *Dropdown* component would open upwards as soon as it was positioned in the bottom half of the screen, even when there was enough room to open downwards. From now on, a *Dropdown* component will only open upwards if there is not enough room below it to open downwards.

### Fixes

#### Low-Code Apps: Problem when a 'Close a panel' event was linked to a component action involving a lazy loaded component [ID 42302]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When a *Close a panel* event was linked to a component action, the panel would not get closed when the component in question was a lazy loaded component that was not loaded yet.

From now on, in cases like this, the component will be forced to render and the component action will be executed. As a result, the *Close a panel* event will be processed.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Migration warning would incorrectly appear when the dashboard or low-code app was up to date [ID 42312]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When a check was performed to determine whether a dashboard or a low-code app had to be migrated to the latest version, and the dashboard or low-code was already up to date, in some cases, the migration warning popup would incorrectly appear.
