### Enhancements

#### NotifyMail.html: Updated report footer [ID 42568]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

In the *C:\\Skyline DataMiner\\NotifyMail.html* file, i.e. the email report template, the report footer has been updated to `Generated by DataMiner`.

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Dashboard would incorrectly be updated before a newly added component had been loaded [ID 42593]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

Up to now, when you had added a component to a dashboard, in some cases, the dashboard would be updated before the new component had been loaded.

From now on, the dashboard will only be updated when the component has been loaded.
