### Fixes

#### Low-Code Apps - Interactive Automation scripts: Redesigned UI components 'Calendar' and 'Time' would incorrectly disregard the configured default time zone [ID 42440]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

Up to now, when a default time zone was configured for the web apps, the redesigned UI components `UIBlockType.Calendar` and `UIBlockType.Time` would incorrectly disregard that default time zone. Instead, they would show the time in the time zone of the web session, and when they returned the client date/time, the time would not match the time they displayed.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Dashboard or low-code app would incorrectly be updated before a newly added component had been loaded [ID 42593]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

Up to now, when you had added a component to a dashboard or a low-code app, in some cases, the dashboard would be updated before the new component had been loaded.

From now on, the dashboard or the low-code app will only be updated when the component has been loaded.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Problem when a Dropdown component was linked to a query that received its data from another component [ID 42609]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

When you had linked a *Dropdown* component to a query that received its data from another component, in some cases, the *Dropdown* component would execute the query even when the query was configured to show nothing when no data is being passed to it.

Also, when you had linked a *Dropdown* component to a query that received its data from another component, in some cases, the *Dropdown* component could get stuck in a loading state.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Image component: Problem when trying to upload an image file of which the extension contained one or more uppercase letters [ID 42638]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

When, in an *Image* component, you tried to upload an image file of which the extension contained one or more uppercase letters, an error would be thrown.

#### Visual Overview in the web apps: Problem when using load balancing [ID 42650]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

When load balancing was being used for Visual Overview in the web apps, in some cases, a particular user session could request a visual overview from an incorrect DataMiner Agent.

#### Dashboards app: Problem after generating a PDF report [ID 42732]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15] / 10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

In some cases, a null reference exception could be thrown after a PDF report had been generated.
