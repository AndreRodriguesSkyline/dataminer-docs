## Changes

### Enhancements

#### GQI DxM: Enhanced detection of extension libraries and automatic reloading of associated extension workers [ID 43604]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

New extension libraries will now be detected asynchronously. Also, when a new version of an existing library is detected, from now on, the associated extension worker will be reloaded to avoid dependency conflicts.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Maps component: Specifying line color conditions in the query filter [ID 43617]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

From now on, map lines can be colored by specifying a color condition in the query filter.

- When a color condition is specified in the query filter, any conditional coloring configured in the *Layout* pane of the *Maps* component will be disregarded until the query filter is removed.

- If the query filter contains multiple color conditions, only the first color condition will be applied. Because a line can only have one color, all other color conditions will be disregarded.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Grid component: Enhanced default selection behavior [ID 43625]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the default selection behavior of the *Grid* component.

When, after a reload, no items are selected (because none were selected before the reload or because the items selected before the reload are no longer displayed), from now on, the *Select first item by default* setting will be applied.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Table & Maps components: 'Old column' renamed to 'Unknown column' and 'Old query' renamed to 'Unknown marker' or 'Unknown line' [ID 43630]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

In the configuration settings of a *Table* component, up to now, templates for columns that had been removed would be named "Old column". From now on, they will be named "Unknown column" instead.

In the configuration settings of a *Maps* component, up to now, settings for markers or lines that had been removed would be named "Old query". From now on, they will be named either "Unknown marker" or "Unknown line" instead.

#### Low-Code Apps: 'Clear selection' component action now available in more components [ID 43635]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

Up to now, the *Clear selection* component action could only be configured for the *Table* and *Node edge graph* components. From now on, it will also be possible to configure this component action for the following components:

- *Dropdown*
- *Grid*
- *List*
- *Maps*
- *State* (for queries and tables only)
- *Timeline*
- *Tree*

> [!NOTE]
> The *Dropdown* component will not clear the selection when its *Clear selection* option is disabled.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Default number of columns on dashboards and low-code app pages has been increased to 50 [ID 43655]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

Dashboards and pages of low-code apps are made up of a number of columns that help you place components in an orderly fashion.

The default number of columns has now been increased to 50.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Standard Skyline themes now have a default title font size of 14px [ID 43661]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

In all standard Skyline themes, the default title font size has been reduced from 16px to 14px.

### Fixes

#### Users with the 'User must change password at next login' setting enabled would incorrectly not be able to log on to the web apps [ID 43590]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.11 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, users had the *User must change password at next login* setting enabled, up to now, they would incorrectly not be able to log on to the web apps as they were not able to change their password when logging on.

From now on, when the password of a user has expired in DataMiner, the web method `ConnectAppAndInfo` will return a message of type "PasswordExpired".

> [!NOTE]
> This will not work with user passwords that expired in Microsoft Windows as DataMiner is not able to authenticate such users.

#### Web apps: Default time zone specified in ClientSettings.json file would incorrectly be disregarded when clicking 'Now' in the redesigned datetime picker component [ID 43632]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

When you clicked the *Now* button in the redesigned datetime picker component, the component would incorrect not take into account the default time zone that was specified in the *ClientSettings.json* file.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps: Problem when entering a negative number in a numeric filter box [ID 43649]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

When you entered a negative number in a numeric filter box, the filter would clear itself while you were typing.

#### DataMiner landing page would no longer list any custom static apps [ID 43656]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

The DataMiner landing page (by default accessible via `https://<DMA IP or hostname>/root`) would incorrectly no longer list any custom static app.
