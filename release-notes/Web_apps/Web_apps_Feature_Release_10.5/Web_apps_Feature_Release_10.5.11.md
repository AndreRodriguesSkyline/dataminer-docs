## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Maps component: Specifying line color conditions in the query filter [ID 43617]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

From now on, map lines can be colored by specifying a color condition in the query filter.

- When a color condition is specified in the query filter, any conditional coloring configured in the *Layout* pane of the *Maps* component will be disregarded until the query filter is removed.

- If the query filter contains multiple color conditions, only the first color condition will be applied. Because a line can only have one color, all other color conditions will be disregarded.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Grid component: Enhanced default selection behavior [ID 43625]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the default selection behavior of the *Grid* component.

When, after a reload, no items are selected (because none were selected before the reload or because the items selected before the reload are no longer displayed), from now on, the *Select first item by default* setting will be applied.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Table & Maps components: 'Old column' renamed to 'Unknown column' and 'Old query' renamed to 'Unknown marker' or 'Unknown line' [ID 43630]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

In the configuration settings of a *Table* component, up to now, templates for columns that had been removed would be named "Old column". From now on, they will be named "Unknown column" instead.

In the configuration settings of a *Maps* component, up to now, settings for markers or lines that had been removed would be named "Old query". From now on, they will be named either "Unknown marker" or "Unknown line" instead.

#### Low-Code Apps: 'Clear selection' component action now available in more components [ID 43635]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

Up to now, the *Clear selection* component action could only be configured for the *Table* and *Node edge graph* components. From now on, it will also be possible to configure this component action for the following components:

- *Dropdown*
- *Grid*
- *List*
- *Maps*
- *State* (for queries and tables only)
- *Timeline*
- *Tree*

> [!NOTE]
> The *Dropdown* component will not clear the selection when its *Clear selection* option is disabled.

### Fixes

#### Web apps: Default time zone specified in ClientSettings.json file would incorrectly be disregarded when clicking 'Now' in the redesigned datetime picker component [ID 43632]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

When you clicked the *Now* button in the redesigned datetime picker component, the component would incorrect not take into account the default time zone that was specified in the *ClientSettings.json* file.
