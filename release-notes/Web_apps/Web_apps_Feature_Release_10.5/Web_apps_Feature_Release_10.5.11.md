## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Maps component: Specifying line color conditions in the query filter [ID 43617]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

From now on, map lines can be colored by specifying a color condition in the query filter.

- When a color condition is specified in the query filter, any conditional coloring configured in the *Layout* pane of the *Maps* component will be disregarded until the query filter is removed.

- If the query filter contains multiple color conditions, only the first color condition will be applied. Because a line can only have one color, all other color conditions will be disregarded.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Grid component: Enhanced default selection behavior [ID 43625]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the default selection behavior of the *Grid* component.

When, after a reload, no items are selected (because none were selected before the reload or because the items selected before the reload are no longer displayed), from now on, the *Select first item by default* setting will be applied.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Table & Maps components: 'Old column' renamed to 'Unknown column' and 'Old query' renamed to 'Unknown marker' or 'Unknown line' [ID 43630]

<!-- 10.4.0 [CU20] / MR 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

In the configuration settings of a *Table* component, up to now, templates for columns that had been removed would be named "Old column". From now on, they will be named "Unknown column" instead.

In the configuration settings of a *Maps* component, up to now, settings for markers or lines that had been removed would be named "Old query". From now on, they will be named either "Unknown marker" or "Unknown line" instead.

### Fixes

*No fixes have been added yet.*
