## Highlights

*No highlights have been selected yet.*

## New features

#### Low-Code Apps - Time range component: New 'Set value' action [ID 40569]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

It is now possible to configure a *Set value* action for a *Time range* component.

This action will allow users to set the current value of the component in question to either a preset range (today, yesterday, next year, ...) or a custom range (which can be either a static value or a feed).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Web API - DataMiner Object Models: Client applications will now be notified when a DOM instance no longer matches the subscription filter [ID 40621]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

From now on, when a DOM instance no longer matches the subscription filter, the client application will be notified.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Time range component: Apply and Cancel buttons [ID 40622]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

Up to now, when you set a custom time range in the *Time range* component, the feed of the component would immediately be updated. From now on, the feed will only be updated when you click the *Apply* button.

Clicking the *Cancel* button will close the time range picker without updating the feed.

### Fixes

#### Low-Code Apps - Form component: Dropdown fields containing elements, resources or service definitions would show an incorrect warning message [ID 40399]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

Up to now, dropdown fields defined as `ElementFieldDescriptor`, `ResourceFieldDescriptor` or `ServiceDefinitionFieldDescriptor` would display all items. However, when there were more than 100 items, an incorrect message would appear, stating that not all values were being displayed.

This behavior has now changed:

- If a dropdown field is defined as `ElementFieldDescriptor`, the above-mentioned message will no longer appear. The field will always show all elements.

- If a dropdown field is defined as `ResourceFieldDescriptor` or `ServiceDefinitionFieldDescriptor`, it will now initially show only 100 items. When there are more than 100 items, a message will appear, indicating that there are more items.

Also, dropdown fields defined as `ResourceFieldDescriptor` or `ServiceDefinitionFieldDescriptor` will now use a paging mechanism (in case of the former, only if the DataMiner server version is 10.4.9 or newer).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If a resource is found in multiple resource pools, it will appear in a dropdown field multiple times (i.e. once for every pool it is found in).
> - If a dropdown field defined as `ResourceFieldDescriptor` or `ServiceDefinitionFieldDescriptor` contains more than 100 items, it is advised to adapt the filter in order to reduce the number of items in the dropdown field.

#### Dashboards app: Folders of which the name contained a slash ('/') or a backslash ('\\') character would stay hidden [ID 40532]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you created a dashboard folder of which the name contained a slash ("/") or a backslash ("\\") character, up to now, the folder would be created, but would stay hidden. It would not appear in the folder structure.

From now on, when you enter a folder name containing a slash ("/") or a backslash ("\\") character, an `Invalid folder name message` will appear.

#### Dashboards app: Inconsistent folder selection behavior [ID 40561]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When a dashboard folder contained child folders, up to now, the main folder would open when you clicked it once, while the child folders would only open when you clicked them twice. From now on, all dashboard folders will open when you click their chevron once.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Security: Users would incorrectly not have a profile picture [ID 40617]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you were configuring user access to a dashboard, a dashboard folder or a low-code app, up to now, users would incorrectly not have a profile picture. From now on, every user will have a profile picture.

#### Dashboards/Low-Code Apps - Security: Access permissions of a duplicated dashboard would not be identical to those of the original dashboard [ID 40627]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When a user duplicated a dashboard that everyone was allowed to edit, up to now, the newly created duplicate could incorrectly only be edited by the user who duplicated the dashboard. From now on, when you duplicate a dashboard, the access permissions of the newly created duplicate will be identical to those of the original dashboard.

#### Dashboards app: Problem when trying to delete a dashboard subfolder [ID 40634]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you tried to delete a subfolder of a dashboard folder, in some cases, an error could be thrown. That error would incorrectly state that the folder name cannot be empty.

#### Dashboards app: Not possible to update the access permissions of the root folder [ID 40644]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

In some cases, it would not be possible to update the access permissions of the root folder.

#### Dashboards app: Newly added folder would incorrectly be shown twice in the UI [ID 40649]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you added a new dashboard folder, up to now, that folder would incorrectly be shown twice in the UI.
