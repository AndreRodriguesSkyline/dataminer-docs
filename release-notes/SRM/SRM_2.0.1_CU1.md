# SRM 2.0.1 CU1

## Enhancements

#### No more waiting time for resources to be active before they are added to a service [ID 41138]

The SRM framework will now no longer wait for resource elements to be active before adding them to a service. This way, if a booking starts with a stopped element, there will no longer be a delay at the start of the booking.
