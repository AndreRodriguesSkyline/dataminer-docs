## Enhancements

#### Support added for updated service creation behavior [ID 39162]

In DataMiner [10.4.5](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.4.5#not-possible-to-delete-a-service-created-via-an-srm-booking-when-it-had-been-assigned-a-name-that-was-already-being-used-id-38914) (as well as 10.3.0 [CU14] and 10.4.0 [CU2]), to prevent an issue when a service was created via an SRM booking and it had an error because the name was already in use by another object, new behavior was introduced when an SRM service is created with a name that already exists. Previously, when an existing name was passed with a different ID, the existing service name was returned, while now an error is thrown. The SRM framework has now been adapted to support this new behavior, while also remaining compatible with the previous behavior.

#### Timeout during booking creation now uses Retry Timeout setting [ID 39481]

When a booking is created using the SRM framework API, the service creation timeout is now no longer fixed to a value of 30 seconds, but instead the *Retry Timeout* setting from the Booking Manager is applied. A service gets created during booking creation when services are persistent or for a contributing booking.
