# EPM 7.0.10 Integrated DOCSIS - Preview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are still working on this release. Release notes may still be modified, added, or moved to a later release. Check back soon for updates!

## New features

#### New dashboard to monitor whether KPI exceeds threshold for specific period [ID 42406]

A new dashboard is now available with the name *US FN Breach Report (OFDMA)* and *US FN Breach Report (SC-QAM)*. It allows you to monitor whether a KPI is higher than a specific threshold for a specific period of time. It makes use a of new ad hoc data source (*EPM_I_DOCSIS_GQI_GET_BREACH_DATA*) that reports the fiber nodes that breached a threshold for a specific number of months in a row. This is checked in weekly increments. This means that if for example a month is selected, the dashboard will check whether for that period of time (i.e. a month), the threshold was breached at least once every week.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Cisco CBR-8 CCAP UTSC: Improved management of FTP settings to prevent data loss [ID 43203]

Up to now, after a reboot or software upgrade of the device , the Cisco CBR-8 CCAP UTSC connector removed FTP settings available in the *PNM Bulk Data Transfer Configuration Table* (SNMP OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4491.2.1.27.1.1.3.1). However, these define the destinations for telemetry data generated by the CCAP, including details about the PNM UTSC tests supported by this solution. This means that data could be lost after a reboot or upgrade.

To prevent this, the connector will now store and sync the FTP settings, ensuring they are always backed up and restored by DataMiner. If a reboot or upgrade happens, the settings stored in the UTSC element will automatically be pushed to the CCAP again.

In addition, users will now be able to configure the *PNM Bulk Data Transfer Configuration Table* directly from the CCAP UTSC element.

#### Cisco CBR-8 CCAP UTSC/Generic SFTP Client: Improved spectrum capture process [ID 43237]

Previously, it could occur that it was not clear when all spectrum trace results were processed. To improve this, after a UTSC capture is triggered, the Cisco CBR-8 CCAP UTSC logic will now wait for the duration that combines the free run duration with one repeat block and the user-configured delay before handing control to the Generic SFTP Client element. This will ensure that every payload file is safely written to local storage. The UTSC will then send both the timestamp of the final payload file and the expected total number of payload files to the SFTP element, so it knows when the last file has arrived, delivering a reliable, self-terminating capture workflow.
