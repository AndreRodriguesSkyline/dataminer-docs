### Enhancements

#### DataMiner upgrade: ModuleInstaller upgrade action timeout has been increased to 30 minutes [ID 42659]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Up to now, the ModuleInstaller upgrade action would time out after 15 minutes. As this action typically runs for more than 15 minutes, this would ofter cause a notice to be logged.

From now on, the ModuleInstaller upgrade action will only time out after 30 minutes.
