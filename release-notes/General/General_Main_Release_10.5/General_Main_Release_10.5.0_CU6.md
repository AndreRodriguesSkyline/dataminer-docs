### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added yet.*

### Fixes

#### Elements deleted during an element migration could incorrectly not be recovered when an action failed [ID 42976]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When some action would fail during one of the phases of an element migration, up to now, there would be no way to recover any elements that had already been deleted.

From now on, elements will only be deleted once all steps in the migration process have been completed successfully. Moreover, if a step in the process fails after an element has been deleted, it will now be possible to manually recover the deleted element.

#### Service & Resource Management: Reservation ID of a service created from a service template would disappears when the template was re-applied [ID 43090]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a service created from a service template had a reservation ID defined, up to now, that reservation ID would incorrectly disappear when the service template was re-applied.

#### Service replication would not work when a gRPC connection was being used [ID 43133]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, service replication would not work when a gRPC connection was being used.

#### SLDMS and SLDataMiner could get into a deadlock when redundancy group properties were being updated [ID 43148]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, SLDMS and SLDataMiner could get into a deadlock when redundancy group properties were being updated.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Redirect tags in DMS.xml would incorrectly not be taken into account [ID 43172]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When `<Redirect via="..." />` tags were configured in the *DMS.xml* file, these would incorrectly not be taken into account when an SLNet instance retrieved upgrade progress messages from another SLNet instance.

Although the upgrade would succeed in the background, no information regarding the remote agents would be available in DataMiner Cube or the DataMiner TaskBar Utility during the upgrade, and notices saying that `http://<ip>:8004/UpgradeService` was unavailable would be added to the logs.

#### OpenSearch: Queries with a limit could cause scroll contexts to linger [ID 43191]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In OpenSearch, in some cases, queries with a limit could cause scroll contexts to linger. From now on, queries with a limit will be properly tracked and cleaned up.

#### BrokerGateway would not be able to retrieve local IP addresses at start-up [ID 43209]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

As BrokerGateway is started alongside the Microsoft Windows operating system, in some cases, it would not be able to retrieve the local IP addresses of the server.

To prevent being unaware of certain IP addresses, from now on, BrokerGateway will not only refresh its IP address cache every 5 minutes, it will also refresh that cache each time it detects a network adapter update.

#### Start-up process of a DMA without Swarming enabled would fail abruptly if no db.xml file was present [ID 43274]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that did not have Swarming enabled was started without a *db.xml* file present, up to now, the start-up process would fail abruptly because of an unhandled exception in SLNet. From now on, it will fail gracefully.
