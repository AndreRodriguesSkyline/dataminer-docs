## Highlights

## New features

#### gRPC now used by default for communication between DataMiner Agents [ID 43190] [ID 43260] [ID 43305] [ID 43331] [ID 43435] [ID 43506]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, .Net Remoting was used by default for communication between DataMiner Agents, though it was possible to set gRPC as the default instead (either by adding *Redirect* tags in DMS.xml or by disabling .NET Remoting in *MaintenanceSettings.xml*). Now gRPC will be the default instead, which means that the *EnableDotNetRemoting* setting in *MaintenanceSettings.xml* is now by default set to *false*.

When you upload an upgrade package that includes this change, the *VerifyGRPCConnection* prerequisite check will run to verify whether all DataMiner Agents in the cluster are ready to switch to using gRPC as the default communication type. This check will fail in case a possible configuration issue or connectivity issue is detected. For details, refer to [Upgrade fails because of VerifyGRPCConnection.dll prerequisite](xref:KI_Upgrade_fails_VerifyGRPCConnection_prerequisite).

We recommend uploading the package prior to the maintenance window for the upgrade, so you can already check beforehand whether all requirements for the upgrade are met and address any possible issues.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### 'Webpages\Public' folder now synced between DataMiner Agents [ID 43458]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.10 -->

The folder `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Webpages\Public\` will now be synced between DataMiner Agents in a cluster. As a consequence, files that are installed in this folder can now also be included in the companion files of a DataMiner app package.

### Fixes

#### SLDataMiner issue after connection type of element changed [ID 43249]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU19] / 10.5.0 [CU7] - FR 10.5.10 -->

In some cases, a problem could occur in SLDataMiner when the connection type of an element changed. To prevent this, the validation of SNMPv3 usernames has now been improved.

#### Slow handling of concurrent requests to retrieve or update bookings [ID 43450]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.10 -->

When a lot of concurrent requests had to be processed by the Repository API in the background, e.g. to retrieve or update bookings, this could cause thread starvation in SLDataGateway, causing these requests to be handled much more slowly than usual.

#### Failed upgrade action because of duplicate keys for SNMPv3 elements [ID 43477]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU19] / 10.5.0 [CU7] - FR 10.5.10 -->

In some cases, it could occur that the SyncInfo file contained duplicate keys for SNMPv3 elements, which would cause upgrade actions to fail with the following error message: `UpgradeAction failed:System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added.`
