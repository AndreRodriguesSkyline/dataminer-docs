## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner upgrade: ModuleInstaller upgrade action timeout has been increased to 30 minutes [ID 42659]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Up to now, the ModuleInstaller upgrade action would time out after 15 minutes. As this action typically runs for more than 15 minutes, this would ofter cause a notice to be logged.

From now on, the ModuleInstaller upgrade action will only time out after 30 minutes.

### Fixes

#### Not all DCF interfaces would be listed in the Connectivity tab of an element's Properties window [ID 42591]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.7 -->

When, in e.g. DataMiner Cube, you opened the *Connectivity* tab in the *Properties* window of an element, in some rare cases, not all DCF interfaces would be listed.

#### LDAP users added as part of an LDAP user group would incorrectly appear as local users instead of domain users [ID 42743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

Up to now, LDAP users who had been added to DataMiner as part of an LDAP user group would incorrectly appear as local users instead of domain users.

#### Problem with SLNet caused by 'DefaultUpgradeOptions' element in MaintenanceSettings.xml file [ID 42746]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU16]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.7 -->

When, in the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file, the `<SLNet>` element contained a `<DefaultUpgradeOptions>` sub-element, up to now, SLNet would fail to start up correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> The above-mentioned `<DefaultUpgradeOptions>` element will be added to the *MaintenanceSettings.xml* file the first time you make any changes to the default upgrade options. To change these options in DataMiner Cube, go to *System Center > System Settings > Upgrade*.

#### Problem when upgrading a DMA using BrokerGateway [ID 42853]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.7 -->

While a DataMiner Agent using BrokerGateway was being upgraded, in some cases, a `nats-server could not be started` error could get thrown.
