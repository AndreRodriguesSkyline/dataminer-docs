## Highlights

*No highlights have been selected yet.*

## New features

#### Automation scripts: New Interactivity tag [ID 42954]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, Automation scripts using the IAS Interactive Toolkit required a special comment or code snippet in order to be recognized as interactive. From now on, you will be able to define the interactive behavior of an Automation script by adding an `<Interactivity>` tag in the header of the script. See the following example.

```xml
<DMSScript xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/automation">
  ...  
  <Interactivity>Always</Interactivity>
  ...
  <Script>
    ...
  </Script>
</DMSScript>
```

Possible values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Auto     | Like before, an attempt will be made to automatically detect the interactive behavior of the script. |
| Never    | The script will never show any UI element. |
| Optional | The script will be interactive when it needs to be. |
| Always   | The script will always be interactive. |

#### Automation script and QAction dependencies can now also be uploaded to the 'DllImport\\SolutionLibraries' folder [ID 43108]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, the `UploadScriptDependencyMessage` was only able to upload Automation script and QAction dependencies to the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Scripts\DllImport` folder. From now on, it will also be able to upload those dependencies to the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ProtocolScripts\DllImport\SolutionLibraries` folder.

See the following example. The `UploadScriptDependencyMessage` now has a `DependencyFolder` property, which allows you to specify the destination of the dependency to be uploaded.

```csharp
var uploadDependencyMessage = new UploadScriptDependencyMessage()
{
  Bytes = bytes,
  DependencyName = name,
  Path = string.Empty, // Subfolders within the destination can be specified here
  DependencyFolder = ScriptDependencyFolder.SolutionLibraries // Default is 'ScriptDependencyFolder.ScriptImports'
};
```

After a dependency has been uploaded, all scripts using that dependency will be recompiled.

> [!NOTE]
> For QActions in protocols, the relevant SLScripting process must be restarted before the new DLL will get loaded.

#### SLNet: 'TraceId' property added to ClientRequestMessage & extended logging [ID 43187]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

The `ClientRequestMessage` class has been extended with a new `TraceInfo` class, which has one `TraceId` property of type string. In a later phase, this property will be used to track requests across multiple modules (e.g. queries coming from ad hoc data sources).

CrudLoggerProxy logging will also support trace IDs for CRUD operations by the following managers:

- AppPackageContentManager
- BaseFunctionManager
- BaseProfileManager
- BPAManager
- ClusterEndpointsManager
- ClusterManager
- ConfigurationManager
- DOMManager
- IncrementManager
- JobManager
- MigrationManager
- ModuleSettingsManager
- NATSCustodianManager
- SRMServiceStateManager
- TicketingManager
- UserDefinableApiManager
- VisualManager

Examples of CRUD operation log entries with a trace ID:

```txt
2025/07/02 13:19:14.170|SLNet.exe|CrudLoggerProxy|INF|3|6|[Trace: AUT/98731f18-15ca-421c-9ed7-f93346160d89] Object: SectionDefinition, Forced: False, User: DOMAIN\UserName, Action: Creating CustomSectionDefinition[IDQ1XPM7DXBIL9YXKWZZ,c74e85be-2c1d-4002-aaba-a3b7d712fe3a].

2025/07/02 13:19:14.457|SLNet.exe|CrudLoggerProxy|INF|3|6|[Trace: AUT/98731f18-15ca-421c-9ed7-f93346160d89] Object: SectionDefinition, Forced: False, User: DOMAIN\UserName, Action: Created CustomSectionDefinition[IDQ1XPM7DXBIL9YXKWZZ,c74e85be-2c1d-4002-aaba-a3b7d712fe3a].
```

Also, the trace ID will be logged for the following messages:

- slow client messages (in *SLNet.txt* and *SLSlowClientMessages.txt*)

  ```txt
  2025/07/02 13:19:34.715|SLNet.exe|LogSlowClientMessage|INF|0|252|[Trace: AUT/98731f18-15ca-421c-9ed7-f93346160d89] [Facade.HandleMessage] 60908.7999ms were needed to handle Cube (FirstName LastName @ GTC-USERNAME) => Diagnostic Request: Hang ()
  ```

- incoming messages in SLNet (in *SLNet.txt* and *SLNet\FacadeHandleMessage.txt*)

  ```txt
  2025-07-02 15:05:04.329|277|Facade.HandleMessage|[Trace: AUT/98731f18-15ca-421c-9ed7-f93346160d89] Incoming (RTManagerGUI.exe (FirstName LastName @ GTC-USERNAME)): Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Messages.ManagerStoreCreateRequest`1[Skyline.DataMiner.Net.Apps.DataMinerObjectModel.DomDefinition]
  ```

The logging of a DOM manager will now also contain a line indicating the start of status transitions. This will be logged on information level 3, i.e. the same type and level as regular CRUD actions:

```txt
2025/07/02 15:05:11.110|SLNet.exe|HandleStatusTransitionRequest|INF|3|269|[Trace: AUT/98731f18-15ca-421c-9ed7-f93346160d89] Handling status transition with ID 'new_to_closed' for instance with ID '1ff720a3-0aa2-4548-8b51-d8b975e19ea4'.
```

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Failover: NATS cluster state will now be visible in DataMiner Cube's Failover Status window [ID 42250] [ID 43169]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

In DataMiner Cube, the NATS cluster state will now be visible in the *Failover Status* window. This state will indicate whether NATS communication between main agent and backup agent is up and running and whether the *clusterEndpoints.json* file is synchronized between the two agents.

#### OpenSearch: auto_expand_replicas with minimum 0 and maximum 2 [ID 43179]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

In OpenSearch, indexing will now use the `auto_expand_replicas` setting.

If the database consists of a single node at the time of index creation, an index will be made that has no replicas (minimum number of replicas is set to 0). If, at a later stage, nodes are then added to or removed from the cluster, replicas will automatically be assigned up to a maximum of 2 (maximum number of replicas is set to 2).

#### Swarming: An information event will be generated when an element was successfully swarmed [ID 43196]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

From now on, an information event will be generated when an element was successfully swarmed.

Example:

`Swarmed from <DmaName> (<DmaId>) to <DmaName> (<DmaId>) by <UserName>`

> [!NOTE]
> When the source DMA is no longer available or unknown, the information event will be shortened to `Swarmed to <DmaName> (<DmaId>) by <UserName>`.

#### GQI: Enhanced performance when setting up GQI connections [ID 43251]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When executing GQI queries via SLHelper, overall performance has increased when setting up GQI connections.

#### DxMs upgraded [ID 43205] [ID 43298] [ID 43334]

<!-- RN 43205: MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->
<!-- RN 43298: MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->
<!-- RN 43334: MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

The following DataMiner Extension Modules (DxMs), which are included in the DataMiner upgrade package, have been upgraded to the indicated versions:

- DataMiner ArtifactDeployer 1.8.5
- DataMiner CloudGateway 2.17.9
- DataMiner DataAggregator 3.2.0
- DataMiner FieldControl 2.11.4
- DataMiner Orchestrator 1.7.8
- DataMiner SupportAssistant 1.7.5

<!-- RN 43205 / RN 43334 -->As from now, the CloudGateway and DataAggregator DxMs will also be included in DataMiner upgrade packages. However, these DxMs will only be upgraded when an older version is found on the DataMiner Agent. If no older version is found, they will not be installed.

For detailed information about the changes included in those versions, refer to the [DxM release notes](xref:DxM_RNs_index).

#### SLAnalytics: Reduced memory usage because of enhanced management of parameters with constant values [ID 43266]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall memory usage of SLAnalytics has been reduced, especially when managing parameters of which the values remain constant for a long time.

#### NT Notify types NT_SNMP_GET and NT_SNMP_RAW_GET now have infinite loop protection [ID 43273]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

The NT Notify types NT_SNMP_GET (295) and NT_SNMP_RAW_GET (424) now have infinite loop protection.

When an infinite loop is detected, the following will be returned:

- When the `splitErrors` option is set to false, the error message `INFINITE LOOP` will be returned.
- When the `splitErrors` option is set to true, the values will be returned.

#### Relational anomaly detection: Configuration moved from XML file to database [ID 43320]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, the configuration settings of the relational anomaly detection feature were stored in `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Analytics\RelationalAnomalyDetection.xml`. From now on, these settings will be stored in the *ai_rad_models_v2* database table instead.

As a result, all configuration will have to be done using either the *RAD Manager* app or the RAD API.

The first time DataMiner starts up after having been upgraded to version 10.6.0/10.5.9, all configuration settings will automatically be migrated from the *RelationalAnomalyDetection.xml* file to the *ai_rad_models_v2* database table.

Also, a number of smaller changes have been made:

- The response to a `GetRADParameterGroupInfo` message now includes an IsMonitored flag. This flag will indicate whether the (sub)group is correctly being monitored ("true"), or whether an error has occurred that prevents the group from being monitored ("false"). In the latter case, more information can be found in the SLAnalytics logging.
- Instances of (direct) view column parameters provided in the `AddRADParameterGroupMessage` or the `AddRADSubgroupMessage` will now automatically be translated to the base table parameters.
- DVE child parameters provided in the `AddRADParameterGroupMessage` or the `AddRADSubgroupMessage` will now automatically be translated to the parent parameters.
- Security has been added to all RAD messages. From now on, you will no longer be able to edit, remove or retrieve information about groups that contain parameters of elements to which you do not have access. The `GetRADParameterGroupsMessage` will still return all groups though.

#### DataMiner upgrade: BPA tests 'Check Agent Presence Test In NATS' and 'Verify NATS is Running' replaced by 'Verify NATS Cluster' [ID 43359]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

The BPA tests *Check Agent Presence Test In NATS* (which was renamed to *Nats connections between the DataMiner Agents* in DataMiner versions 10.5.0/10.4.12) and *Verify NATS is Running* have now both been replaced by the *Verify NATS Cluster* test.

This means that, from now on, during a DataMiner upgrade, the *Verify NATS Cluster* test will be installed and any existing instances of the deprecated *Check Agent Presence Test In NATS* and *Verify NATS is Running* tests will be removed.

### Fixes

#### SLProtocol would leak memory when an element was restarted [ID 42697] [ID 43300]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When you restarted an element that had previously been stopped, up to now, SLProtocol would leak memory.

#### SLManagedScripting: The same dependency would be loaded multiple times by different connectors [ID 42779]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, the same dependency would be loaded multiple times by different connectors. From now on, if multiple connectors attempt to load the same dependency at the same time, it will only be loaded once.

#### Problem when a connector had been modified on a system running multiple SLScripting processes [ID 42877]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When, on a system running multiple SLScripting processes, a connector was modified, but its version was left untouched, in some cases, a number of SLScripting processes could incorrectly keep on using outdated QActions or helper libraries, resulting in exceptions like the following being thrown:

`System.ArgumentException: Object of type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Scripting.ConcreteSLProtocolExt' cannot be converted to type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Scripting.SLProtocolExt'`

#### Elements deleted during an element migration could incorrectly not be recovered when an action failed [ID 42976]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When some action would fail during one of the phases of an element migration, up to now, there would be no way to recover any elements that had already been deleted.

From now on, elements will only be deleted once all steps in the migration process have been completed successfully. Moreover, if a step in the process fails after an element has been deleted, it will now be possible to manually recover the deleted element.

#### Problem when restarting an element multiple times in rapid succession [ID 42996]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When an element was restarted multiple times in rapid succession, in some cases, an run-time error could occur in the parameter thread of SLElement.

#### Problem when stopping an element or performing a Failover switch when another action was being executed [ID 43089]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When you stopped an element or performed a Failover switch when another action was being executed (e.g. a parameter set being performed by a QAction), in some cases, a deadlock could occur.

#### Service & Resource Management: Reservation ID of a service created from a service template would disappears when the template was re-applied [ID 43090]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a service created from a service template had a reservation ID defined, up to now, that reservation ID would incorrectly disappear when the service template was re-applied.

#### Incorrect license check could cause DaaS systems to shut down [ID 43100]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, when a DaaS system was not able to validate its license, after a certain amount of time it would shut down because of an incorrect license check.

#### Service replication would not work when a gRPC connection was being used [ID 43133]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, service replication would not work when a gRPC connection was being used.

#### Service & Resource Management: Booking could incorrectly be set to 'Confirmed' indefinitely [ID 43140]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a booking with status "Ongoing" or "Ended" had its timing or one of its properties updated, in some cases, its status could incorrectly remain set to "Confirmed" indefinitely. This behavior has now been fixed.

Also, from now on, the booking status will only be set to "Confirmed" in the following cases:

- When the start time of the new booking is in the future.
- When the prior reservation has ended, and the new end time is extended to a point in the future beyond the original end time.

#### SLDMS and SLDataMiner could get into a deadlock when redundancy group properties were being updated [ID 43148]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, SLDMS and SLDataMiner could get into a deadlock when redundancy group properties were being updated.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Redirect tags in DMS.xml would incorrectly not be taken into account [ID 43172]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When `<Redirect via="..." />` tags were configured in the *DMS.xml* file, these would incorrectly not be taken into account when an SLNet instance retrieved upgrade progress messages from another SLNet instance.

Although the upgrade would succeed in the background, no information regarding the remote agents would be available in DataMiner Cube or the DataMiner TaskBar Utility during the upgrade, and notices saying that `http://<ip>:8004/UpgradeService` was unavailable would be added to the logs.

#### OpenSearch: Queries with a limit could cause scroll contexts to linger [ID 43191]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In OpenSearch, in some cases, queries with a limit could cause scroll contexts to linger. From now on, queries with a limit will be properly tracked and cleaned up.

#### BrokerGateway would not be able to retrieve local IP addresses at start-up [ID 43209]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

As BrokerGateway is started alongside the Microsoft Windows operating system, in some cases, it would not be able to retrieve the local IP addresses of the server.

To prevent being unaware of certain IP addresses, from now on, BrokerGateway will not only refresh its IP address cache every 5 minutes, it will also refresh that cache each time it detects a network adapter update.

#### AnnounceHostingAgentEvent instances could linger around in the cache after a remote agent had reconnected [ID 43230]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.9 -->
<!-- Not added to MR 10.6.0 -->

When a remote agent disconnected and later reconnected, in some cases, `AnnounceHostingAgentEvent` instances could linger around in the cache even though the event, element, service or redundancy group no longer existed on that remote agent.

#### Failover: Primary IP address could incorrectly be set to the IP address of the online agent [ID 43257]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, in a Failover setup using a shared hostname, in some cases, the primary IP address would incorrectly be set to the IP address of the online agent instead of the hostname. Moreover, if that primary IP address was set to an incorrect IP address, it would be impossible to remove the Failover pair from the DataMiner System.

Also, from now on, the primary IP address of the offline agent will be set to either the virtual IP address or the hostname of the Failover pair. Up to now, it would be set to the local IP address.

#### Start-up process of a DMA without Swarming enabled would fail abruptly if no db.xml file was present [ID 43274]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that did not have Swarming enabled was started without a *db.xml* file present, up to now, the start-up process would fail abruptly because of an unhandled exception in SLNet. From now on, it will fail gracefully.

#### BrokerGateway: GetConnectionDetails call would incorrectly not return any destinations [ID 43292]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When using the BrokerGateway-managed NATS solution, in some cases, the `GetConnectionDetails` call would incorrectly not return any destinations when an attempt was made to connect to NATS.

Also, up to now, when a `GetNatsConnection` call was made while no endpoints were specified in the *appsettings.runtime.json* file, the response would incorrectly contain `nats://<ip>:4222` instead of `<ip>:4222`.

#### Problem when deleting a DVE child element [ID 43302]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, a run-time error could be thrown when a DVE child element was deleted.

#### Problem when an error was thrown while setting up the Repository API connections between SLDataGateway and SLNet [ID 43314]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When an error was thrown while setting up the Repository API connections between SLDataGateway and SLNet, in some cases, threads in SLNet could get stuck indefinitely, causing certain DataMiner features (e.g. DOM, SRM, etc.) to not being able to progress beyond their initialization phase.
