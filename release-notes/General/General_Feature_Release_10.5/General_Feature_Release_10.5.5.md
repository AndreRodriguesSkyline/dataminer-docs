## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID 42307]

<!-- 42307: MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLLogCollector now collects the output of the 'dotnet --list-runtimes' command [ID 42448]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

SLLogCollector packages will now include the output of the `dotnet --list-runtimes` command.

The output will be stored in the following file:

*\\Logs\\Windows\\.NET runtimes\\cmd.exe _c dotnet --list-runtimes.txt*

### Fixes

#### Problem with aggregation alarms on Cassandra Cluster and STaaS [ID 42095]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

Up to now, aggregation alarms would not work as intended on DataMiner Systems using a Cassandra Cluster database or Storage as a Service (STaaS).

#### Element card of a DVE or Virtual Function could show incorrect alarm colors [ID 42402]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

In some cases, the `ParameterChangeEvent` or `ParameterTableUpdateEventMessage` for a primary key cell would contain an invalid `InstanceAlarmlevel` or `CellBubbleUpLevel`. As a result, when you opened an element card of a DVE or a Virtual Function, the card pages would show incorrect alarm colors.

#### STaaS: Problem with logger table queries incorrectly not yielding any results [ID 42408]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When a logger table was queried, in some cases, the query would incorrectly not yield any results due to a filter conversion issue.

#### Problem when deleting an element or service property [ID 42434]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14]/10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When an element property or a service property was deleted, in some cases, a `KeyNotFoundException` exception could be thrown, especially when one of the elements that had a value for that property was a migrated or a swarmed element.

The property would be deleted from the *PropertyConfiguration.xml* file, but not from the elements or services that had a value for the property in question.
