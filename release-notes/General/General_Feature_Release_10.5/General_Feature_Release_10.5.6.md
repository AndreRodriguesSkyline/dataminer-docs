## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Cassandra Cluster: Enhanced performance when importing DELT packages [ID 42613]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15]/10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when importing DELT packages on systems with a database of type *Cassandra Cluster*, especially when those packages contain a large amount of trend data.

### Fixes

#### Problem with SLProtocol when a protocol version was overwritten while an element using that protocol version was starting up [ID 42344]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15]/10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

When a protocol version was overwritten while an element using that protocol version was starting up, in some cases, the SLProtocol process could stop working. Also, this could result in alarms like the following being generated:

`Unexpected Exception [Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004024C]: The element is unknown.`

#### Redundancy groups: Matrix parameter updates in a derived element would incorrectly not get applied in the source element (and vice versa) [ID 42598]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU15]/10.5.0 [CU3] - FR 10.5.6 -->

When, within a redundancy group, a matrix parameter in a derived element was updated, in some cases, that same matrix parameter would incorrectly not get updated in the source element (and vice versa).
