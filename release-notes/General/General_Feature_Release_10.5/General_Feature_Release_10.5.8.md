## New features

#### Interactive Automation scripts executed in a web app: Filtering values in a dropdown box [ID 42808]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.8 -->

To prevent dropdown boxes in interactive Automation scripts to get loaded with too much data, it is now possible to filter the data that is loaded into a dropdown box.

For an example showing how to implement a dropdown box filter in an interactive Automation script, see [Interactive Automation scripts: Filtering values in a redesigned UI component 'DropDown' [ID 42845]](xref:Web_apps_Feature_Release_10.5.8#interactive-automation-scripts-filtering-values-in-a-redesigned-ui-component-dropdown-id-42845).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only supported for interactive Automation scripts executed in web apps. It is not supported for interactive Automation scripts executed in DataMiner Cube.

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner upgrade: All TXF files will now be removed each time a DataMiner upgrade is performed [ID 43058]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

From now on, each time a DataMiner upgrade is performed, all TXF files will be automatically removed from the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Scripts\` folder.

When you create an Automation script, apart from an XML file containing the actual script, a number of TXF files will be created. These will contain cached query information to speed up XML querying.

### Fixes

#### Problem when combining conditional monitoring templates into an alarm template group [ID 42839]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

When multiple conditional alarm templates had been combined into an alarm template group, up to now, the resulting group template could fail to properly apply its conditions.

#### SLDataGateway could stop working because of issues caused by TPL tasks [ID 42846]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

In some cases, SLDataGateway could stop working because of issues caused by TPL tasks.

The number of TPL tasks has now been reduced, especially when writing trend data to the database.

#### Error 'The object exporter specified was not found' would get logged upon DMA startup [ID 42927]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

In some cases, a DataMiner Agent would not start up properly, and the following error would get logged in the *SLDataMiner.txt* log file:

`The object exporter specified was not found`

#### Problem with conditional alarm monitoring based on a condition made up of multiple AND/OR clauses [ID 42942]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

When, in an alarm template, you had configured conditional monitoring based on a condition made up of multiple AND/OR clauses, up to now, some of those AND/OR clauses could incorrectly get disabled when the alarm template was refreshed in SLElement following e.g. a template update.

#### Redundancy groups: Alarm mentioning that all redundancy resources are in use would incorrectly not get cleared [ID 42970]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU17]/10.5.0 [CU4] - FR 10.5.8 -->

If a redundancy group has more primary elements than backup elements, at the moment when all backups are in use, an alarm with severity level "Notice" will appear in the Alarm Console mentioning that all redundancy resources are in use.

By default, that alarm is cleared as soon as one of the backup elements is available again. However, up to now, in some cases, the alarm would incorrectly not get cleared.

#### GQI: GQI DxM and SLHelper could leak memory [ID 43028]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 [CU5] - FR 10.5.8 -->

In some cases, both GQI DxM and SLHelper could leak memory when executing GQI queries.
