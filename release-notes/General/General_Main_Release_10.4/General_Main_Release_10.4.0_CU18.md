### Enhancements

#### GQI: Enhanced performance when setting up GQI connections [ID 43251]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When executing GQI queries via SLHelper, overall performance has increased when setting up GQI connections.

#### NT Notify types NT_SNMP_GET and NT_SNMP_RAW_GET now have infinite loop protection [ID 43273]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

The NT Notify types NT_SNMP_GET (295) and NT_SNMP_RAW_GET (424) now have infinite loop protection.

When an infinite loop is detected, the following will be returned:

- When the `splitErrors` option is set to false, the error message `INFINITE LOOP` will be returned.
- When the `splitErrors` option is set to true, the values will be returned.

#### Automation: An error message will now appear when a script import operation fails [ID 43316]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When, in the *Automation* module, you imported an Automation script, up to now, you would not receive any feedback about whether or not the import operation had been successful. Only after checking the Cube logs would you be able to find out that an import operation had failed.

From now on, the following error message will appear whenever an exception is thrown while an Automation script is being imported:

`Something went wrong. Please check the Cube and Automation logging for more information.`

### Fixes

#### SLProtocol would leak memory when an element was restarted [ID 42697] [ID 43300]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When you restarted an element that had previously been stopped, up to now, SLProtocol would leak memory.

#### SLManagedScripting: The same dependency would be loaded multiple times by different connectors [ID 42779]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, the same dependency would be loaded multiple times by different connectors. From now on, if multiple connectors attempt to load the same dependency at the same time, it will only be loaded once.

#### Problem when a connector had been modified on a system running multiple SLScripting processes [ID 42877]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When, on a system running multiple SLScripting processes, a connector was modified, but its version was left untouched, in some cases, a number of SLScripting processes could incorrectly keep on using outdated QActions or helper libraries, resulting in exceptions like the following being thrown:

`System.ArgumentException: Object of type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Scripting.ConcreteSLProtocolExt' cannot be converted to type 'Skyline.DataMiner.Scripting.SLProtocolExt'`

#### Elements deleted during an element migration could incorrectly not be recovered when an action failed [ID 42976]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When some action would fail during one of the phases of an element migration, up to now, there would be no way to recover any elements that had already been deleted.

From now on, elements will only be deleted once all steps in the migration process have been completed successfully. Moreover, if a step in the process fails after an element has been deleted, it will now be possible to manually recover the deleted element.

#### Problem when restarting an element multiple times in rapid succession [ID 42996]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When an element was restarted multiple times in rapid succession, in some cases, an run-time error could occur in the parameter thread of SLElement.

#### Problem when stopping an element or performing a Failover switch when another action was being executed [ID 43089]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When you stopped an element or performed a Failover switch when another action was being executed (e.g. a parameter set being performed by a QAction), in some cases, a deadlock could occur.

#### Service & Resource Management: Reservation ID of a service created from a service template would disappears when the template was re-applied [ID 43090]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a service created from a service template had a reservation ID defined, up to now, that reservation ID would incorrectly disappear when the service template was re-applied.

#### Incorrect license check could cause DaaS systems to shut down [ID 43100]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, when a DaaS system was not able to validate its license, after a certain amount of time it would shut down because of an incorrect license check.

#### Service replication would not work when a gRPC connection was being used [ID 43133]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, service replication would not work when a gRPC connection was being used.

#### SLDMS and SLDataMiner could get into a deadlock when redundancy group properties were being updated [ID 43148]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, SLDMS and SLDataMiner could get into a deadlock when redundancy group properties were being updated.

#### DataMiner upgrade: Redirect tags in DMS.xml would incorrectly not be taken into account [ID 43172]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When `<Redirect via="..." />` tags were configured in the *DMS.xml* file, these would incorrectly not be taken into account when an SLNet instance retrieved upgrade progress messages from another SLNet instance.

Although the upgrade would succeed in the background, no information regarding the remote agents would be available in DataMiner Cube or the DataMiner TaskBar Utility during the upgrade, and notices saying that `http://<ip>:8004/UpgradeService` was unavailable would be added to the logs.

#### OpenSearch: Queries with a limit could cause scroll contexts to linger [ID 43191]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In OpenSearch, in some cases, queries with a limit could cause scroll contexts to linger. From now on, queries with a limit will be properly tracked and cleaned up.

#### Failover: Primary IP address could incorrectly be set to the IP address of the online agent [ID 43257]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

Up to now, in a Failover setup using a shared hostname, in some cases, the primary IP address would incorrectly be set to the IP address of the online agent instead of the hostname. Moreover, if that primary IP address was set to an incorrect IP address, it would be impossible to remove the Failover pair from the DataMiner System.

Also, from now on, the primary IP address of the offline agent will be set to either the virtual IP address or the hostname of the Failover pair. Up to now, it would be set to the local IP address.

#### Problem when deleting a DVE child element [ID 43302]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some cases, a run-time error could be thrown when a DVE child element was deleted.

#### Problem when an error was thrown while setting up the Repository API connections between SLDataGateway and SLNet [ID 43314]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When an error was thrown while setting up the Repository API connections between SLDataGateway and SLNet, in some cases, threads in SLNet could get stuck indefinitely, causing certain DataMiner features (e.g. DOM, SRM, etc.) to not being able to progress beyond their initialization phase.

#### StorageModule DcM would fail to read an element XML file [ID 43350]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

In some rare cases, the StorageModule DcM would fail to read an element XML file because that file was being used by another process.

From now on, it will try up to three times to read an element XML file that is being used by another process.

#### Fields of type datetime would incorrectly not be empty when the DOM definition field did not have a default value defined [ID 43351]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU18] / 10.5.0 [CU6] - FR 10.5.9 -->

When a DOM definition field does not have a default value defined, by default, no value should be displayed. However, up to now, when the default time zone had been changed in the *ClientSettings.json* file, fields of type datetime would incorrectly contain the value "01/01/1970 - DefaultTimezone".

From now on, if a DOM definition field does not have a default value defined, all fields of that type will be empty when displayed on a form.
