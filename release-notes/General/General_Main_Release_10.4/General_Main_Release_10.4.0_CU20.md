### Enhancements

#### STaaS: Enhanced exception logging [ID 43626]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

A number of enhancements have been made with regard to the logging of exception messages on STaaS systems.

### Fixes

#### Protocols: Problems with pollingRate attribute [ID 43418]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

A number of issues have been fixed with regard to the `pollingRate` attribute, which allows you to slow down polling for specific SNMP columns in a table by specifying a minimum interval (in milliseconds) between polling.

- Using `pollingRate` would not work when the element was using the production version of the protocol or when the `partialSNMP` option was specified in the table options.

- Up to now, the decision to poll a column was taken by SLSNMPManager, which relied on the *Polling.xml* file that was stored alongside the *Protocol.xml* file. From now on, SLProtocol will determine which columns will be polled independently of the *Polling.xml* file.

> [!NOTE]
> Stream Viewer will now indicate more clearly which columns were polled. When some columns were polled while others were skipped, the message `[PollingRate polled column PIDs xxx,yyy]` will be shown. Also, when the timer was faster than the polling rate, the message `No column reached the PollingRate interval.` will be shown, and no Get operation will be executed.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool: Problem when reverse lookup of IP addresses returned hostnames other than those configured in the SSL certificate [ID 43520]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU20] / 10.5.0 [CU8] - FR 10.5.11 -->

When you tried to migrate a Cassandra Cluster with SSL/TLS enabled, up to now, the Cassandra Cluster Migration tool would not be able to initialize when a reverse lookup of IP addresses returned hostnames other than those configured in the SSL certificate.

This issue can be prevented by manually checking if the IP address is one of the SANs (Subject Alternative Names) of the SSL certificate.
