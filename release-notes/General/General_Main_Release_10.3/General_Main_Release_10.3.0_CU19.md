### Enhancements

#### BPA test 'Check Antivirus DLLs' will now also check known antivirus file paths [ID 32567]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

The *Check Antivirus DLLs* test will now also check the path of the loaded antivirus DLL files to check whether they were loaded from a known antivirus path.

This means that the test will now be able to report a fail when a new antivirus DLL file is added or when an existing antivirus DLL file is renamed, even when the file location remains the same.

#### Caching of protocol signature information will enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup [ID 39468]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Information regarding protocol signature validation will now be cached. This will considerably enhance overall performance during a DataMiner startup.

#### Automation: Using the Engine.Sleep method in an Automation script could affect other scripts [ID 40104]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU6] - FR 10.4.9 -->

Up to now, using the *Engine.Sleep* method in an Automation script could cause issues that would affect other scripts. This has now been resolved.

#### BPA tests will no longer be executed immediately after a DataMiner restart [ID 40201]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Up to now, all BPA tests would be executed immediately after DataMiner had been started.

From now on, the *Report Active RTE* test will be executed for the first time exactly 8 minutes after DataMiner has been started, and all other BPA tests will be executed between 10 and 60 minutes after DataMiner has been started.

#### Security enhancements [ID 40229]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.9 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLAnalytics: Reduced memory usage [ID 40450]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall memory usage of SLAnalytics has been reduced.

#### SLNet: DataMiner Cube's Scheduler app will now support user access permissions to specific dashboard folders [ID 40550]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Because of a number of enhancements made to SLNet, DataMiner Cube's Scheduler app will now support user access permissions to specific dashboard folders.

### Fixes

#### Problem in SLDataMiner when redundancy groups were configured to switch based on connectivity [ID 40118]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When redundancy groups were configured to switch based on connectivity, it could occur that the signals sent to SLDataMiner contained duplicates. In a system with a heavy load, this could cause too many of these to be sent, which would cause a memory leak in the SLDataMiner process and eventually caused the process to crash.

Performance improvements have now been implemented to avoid sending duplicate signals and to better process the signals. A throttling mechanism has also been implemented: in case SLDataMiner detects that too many signals are being sent, the DCF calculation will be slowed down to allow the system to catch up. In the logging, this will be mentioned in *SLConnectivity.txt* like in the example below:

```txt
07/04 09:13:32.713|SLNet.exe|Log|INF|0|174|Received throttle request to slowdown DCF path calculation current value: 5000 ms

2024/07/04 09:15:34.019|SLNet.exe|Log|INF|0|172|Received stop throttle request to resume normal DCF path calculation current value: 1000 ms

07/04 09:13:32.713|SLNet.exe|Log|INF|0|174|Received throttle request to slowdown DCF path calculation current value: 5000 ms

2024/07/04 09:16:29.462|SLNet.exe|Log|INF|0|175|Received throttle request to slowdown DCF path calculation current value: 25000 ms

2024/07/04 09:22:51.732|SLNet.exe|Log|INF|0|54|Received stop throttle request to resume normal DCF path calculation current value: 1000 ms
```

#### Changes implemented with parameter-specific template editors not saved correctly [ID 40125]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When you changed the alarm or trend template for a table parameter (e.g. by going to the templates tab on the parameter card), it could occur that the wrong line from the template was edited. For example, if a template contained exactly one line for a column in a table, and that line was configured with the filter "SL*", the parameter template editor would show the configuration corresponding to the line in the template with the filter even if that line was not applicable for the current cell. Now, instead an empty template configuration will be shown, corresponding to the filter "\*". When you edit and save this configuration, a new line with filter "\*" will be added to the template.

In addition, when there were two or more lines in the trend template for a table parameter, but none were applicable for the current cell for which you edited the trend template, the parameter template editor would show and create a new line in the template corresponding to an empty filter, instead of to the filter "\*". This has now also been fixed.

Finally, if you changed the information template for a parameter, and the information template did not contain a line for the current parameter, the ID was not saved correctly. In addition, for table parameters, a line with an empty filter would be saved, instead of the filter "\*".

#### Problem with SLProtocol when using a timer to perform 'SNMP Get' operations [ID 40402]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When using a timer to perform *SNMP Get* operations on all rows in a table, you have two options:

- the thread pool option (which you activate by specifying the *threadPool* keyword), or
- the default logic (which you activate by not specifying the *threadPool* keyword).

When the default logic was used, up to now, when you stopped an element before the *SNMP Get* operations were completed, resources that were still required would incorrectly be cleaned up, leading to the SLProtocol process being stopped.

In order to remedy this behavior, the `DeInit` method of the `protocol` object has now been updated. It will now always wait for the *SNMP Get* operations to finish before proceeding.

Also, up to now, the thread that handles the *SNMP Get* operations would not correctly catch exceptions, which resulted in no crashdump files being automatically generated when exceptions occurred. This made it difficult to diagnose the issue, as it required setting up a procdump and waiting for the issue to occur again.

#### Protocols: Problem when a response with a 'next param' and a 'fixed length' parameter did not have a trailer defined [ID 40430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Up to now, when a response contained a parameter with a LengthType equal to "next param" and another parameter with a LengthType equal to "fixed" but no trailer, SLPort would incorrectly return the payload to SLProtocol as soon as it read at least the number of bytes that was configured in the fixed length parameter.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator: Problem when retrying an alarm migration [ID 40434]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When, using the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*), you retried an alarm migration, the migration would immediately fail and go into a *Cancelled* state.

#### Cassandra Cluster Migrator: Problem when initializing a migration [ID 40476]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When the Cassandra Cluster Migrator tool (*SLCCMigrator.exe*) initialized a migration, SLDataGateway would stop writing alarms to the TimeTrace table. When the migration was subsequently aborted, data would be lost.

#### Problem with SNMPv3 communication when the same device was polled with different credentials [ID 40502]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When two SNMPv3 interfaces pointing to the same device, either on the same element or on two different elements, were using different credentials, SNMP communication using one set of credentials would break as soon as an SNMP operation was executed using the other set of credentials. An element restart was required to get communication working again.

#### DataMiner Object Models: Not possible to create multiple DOM module subscriptions [ID 40508]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

Up to now, when an attempt was made to create multiple DOM module subscriptions at a time, only the first subscription would be created.

From now on, it will be possible to create multiple DOM module subscriptions on one connection.

#### SLAnalytics - Alarm focus: Problem with time of arrival when clearing a focus event [ID 40509]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU19]/10.4.0 [CU7] - FR 10.4.10 -->

When a focus event was cleared because an element had been deleted, up to now, the time of arrival of the new focus event (i.e. the time at which the focus event had been cleared) would incorrectly be identical to the time of arrival of the focus event that had been cleared.

From now on, the time of arrival of the new focus event will instead be the current time (i.e. the time at which the element was deleted).
