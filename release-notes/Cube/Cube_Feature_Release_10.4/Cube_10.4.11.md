## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Visual Overview: All dynamic text in the KPI stencil will now automatically be truncated [ID 40545]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

All dynamic text in the KPI stencil will now automatically be truncated with "..." to prevent it from exceeded the dimensions of a shape.

#### System Center - Logging: Additional log files available in DataMiner tab [ID 40676]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

In the *Logging* section of *System Center*, a number of additional log files can now be consulted in the *DataMiner* tab:

- App Package Installer
- Cluster Transition Manager
- Database Migration
- SAML
- Spectrum Manager
- UI Provider

### Fixes

#### Services: Alarm color of a service card page would be incorrect when the service contained a partially included table of an element [ID 40597]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you opened the card of a service that contained only part of a table of an element, in some cases, the alarm color of the card page would  incorrectly reflect the alarm state of the entire table instead of the consolidated alarm state of the included rows.

#### Alarm Console: Problem when requesting history information events [ID 40646]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you dragged an element onto the Alarm Console and requested the information events of e.g. the last hour, up to now, Cube would send two requests to the server: one to return the alarms and another to return the information events. Unfortunately, the request to return the alarms would always fail, causing the request to return the information events to not get executed. As a result, no information events would appear in the Alarm Console.

From now on, in the above-mentioned situation, only a request to return the information events will be sent to the server.

#### Problem when clearing an alarm after opening a visual overview containing AlarmSummary shapes [ID 40669]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

After you had opened a visual overview containing AlarmSummary shapes while being connected to a DataMiner Agent running version 10.4.9, in some cases, DataMiner Cube could stop working due to an error occurring when an alarm was cleared.

#### Visual Overview: Spectrum measurement point linked to a card variable would incorrectly not be loaded [ID 40681]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When, in an embedded Spectrum Analysis component, you used an inline preset with a measurement point linked to a card variable, that measurement point would incorrectly not be loaded.

#### Router Control app: XML files sent to the DMA were encoded incorrectly [ID 40715]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you make changes to Router Control configurations, those changes are sent to the DataMiner Agent in the form of an XML file.

Up to now, the XML declaration in that file did incorrectly not correspond to the encoding that was used (i.e. UTF-8). From now on, Router Control XML files sent from Cube to the DMA will be encoded in UTF-8 and will also have an XML declaration in which the encoding attribute is set to UTF-8.

#### Cube could leak memory each time you opened the 'Reports' page of a card [ID 40744]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

DataMiner Cube could leak memory each time you opened the *Reports* page of a card.

#### Cards: Problem when opening a page containing a visual overview [ID 40756]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you opened a card page that contained a visual overview, in some rare cases, the page could remain empty, showing a "Loading" message.
