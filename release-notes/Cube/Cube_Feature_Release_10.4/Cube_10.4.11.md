### Fixes

#### Services: Alarm color of a service card page would be incorrect when the service contained a partially included table of an element [ID 40597]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you opened the card of a service that contained only part of a table of an element, in some cases, the alarm color of the card page would  incorrectly reflect the alarm state of the entire table instead of the consolidated alarm state of the included rows.

#### Alarm Console: Problem when requesting history information events [ID 40646]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU20] / 10.4.0 [CU8] - FR 10.4.11 -->

When you dragged an element onto the Alarm Console and requested the information events of e.g. the last hour, up to now, Cube would send two requests to the server: one to return the alarms and another to return the information events. Unfortunately, the request to return the alarms would always fail, causing the request to return the information events to not get executed. As a result, no information events would appear in the Alarm Console.

From now on, in the above-mentioned situation, only a request to return the information events will be sent to the server.
