## Changes

### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Cube desktop app: Enhanced configuration file management and revised drag-and-drop functionality [ID 41203]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

In the DataMiner Cube desktop app, a number of enhancements have been made with regard to configuration file management.

Also, the drag-and-drop functionality has been revised. For example, it is now possible to re-order tile groups and to remove tiles by dragging them onto the recycle bin.

#### Profiles app will now show an error message when a create, update or delete operation fails [ID 41902]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When you used the *Profiles* module to create, update or delete a profile definition, a profile instance, a profile parameter, or a mediation snippet, up to now, you would not get notified when the operation failed. To find out why the operation failed, you had to consult the Cube logging.

From now on, whenever an error occurs while a create, update or delete operation is being performed, the *Profiles* module will open a dialog box showing an error message.

#### Alarm Console: Recursive loop detection in alarm trees [ID 42188]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

From now on, when you right-click an alarm in the Alarm Console and select *Show side panel*, DataMiner Cube will check whether there are loops in the alarm tree, i.e. whether the alarm tree contains any alarms that refer to themselves.

#### Alarm Console: Multivariate pattern suggestion events will now be grouped into a single incident [ID 42287]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When a multivariate pattern is detected in new trend data, suggestion events are generated for every parameter in the linked pattern.

From now on, those suggestion events will be grouped into a single incident, which will be shown as a single line in both the *Suggestion events* tab and the *Patterns* tab of the Alarm Console.

#### Alarm templates: Warning message will now appear when you try to enable smart baselines for a history set parameter [ID 42326]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When you enable smart baselines for a parameter that has its `historySet` option set to true in the connector in question, from now on, a warning message will appear, saying that historySet functionality is incompatible with smart baselines.

> [!NOTE]
> Although, in the UI, the smart baseline option will be enabled for the parameter in question, the option will have no effect as long as the parameter has its `historySet` option set to true in the connector.

#### System Center - System settings: 'Time to live' section will no longer be available when Cube is connected to a DMS using STaaS [ID 42333]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

In *System Center > System settings*, the *Time to live* section will no longer be available when Cube is connected to a DMS using STaaS.

### Fixes

#### Trending: Problem when loading trend data when the trend graph contained both regular average trend data and trend data related to SLAnalytics [ID 42357]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When a trend graph contained both regular average trend data and trend data related to SLAnalytics, in some rare cases, the trend graph could get stuck while loading that data.

#### DMA selection box of duplicate element to be created would not be set to the correct DataMiner Agent [ID 42438]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU14] / 10.5.0 [CU2] - FR 10.5.5 -->

When, in the Surveyor, you right-clicked a migrated or swarmed element, and selecting *Duplicate*, in the element card of the duplicate element to be created, the *DMA* selection box would not be set to the correct DataMiner Agent.
