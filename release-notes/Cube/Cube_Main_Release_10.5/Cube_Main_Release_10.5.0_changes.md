### Fixes

#### Alarm Console: Problem with hyperlinks that should be shown or hidden based on the value of a property [ID 37777]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you had created a hyperlink that should only be shown when a particular property had a certain value, that hyperlink would never be shown when different types of objects (elements, services, views or alarms) had a property with a name identical to that of the property used in the filter.
