#### 16 June 2023 - Fix - Chat Integration with Microsoft Teams: Improved consistency for email inputs [ID 36643]

Consistency for the Chat Integration email input has been improved.

Previously, some features were using the email input as the actual email address of the user, and some were using it as the service principal name of the user. This was not an issue if both had the same value in the linked tenant. However, if the values differed, some features like "Create Team" and "Add Team Member or Owner" did not work unless the actual service principal name was given.

This is now no longer the case. All email input for all Chat Integration features behaves the same as the email address set for the user in the tenant.

#### 30 May 2023 - Enhancement - Catalog - Notification when deploying from the catalog [ID 36543]

If CoreGateway version 2.11.0 or higher and FieldControl version 2.8.1 or higher are installed (included in Cloud Pack version 2.8.2), the DataMiner Teams bot now allows you to display and run custom commands with dynamic user input configured in a DataMiner System connected to dataminer.services.

You can do so using the Teams bot commands *show command \<command name\>*, *show command*, and *run command \<command name\>*.

To add a command to your DMS, create an Automation script in the folder "bot" in the DMS. For examples of such scripts, refer to [Custom Command Examples](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/ChatOps-Extensions/tree/main/CustomCommandExamples) on GitHub.

The commands allow dynamic input, such as dummies, parameters, parameters with value files, and memory files. They support the following output: key values, adaptive card body elements, and JSON.

A command will only be visible for users of the bot if they have the appropriate rights in DataMiner Cube. If users have the necessary rights to view a command, but they do not have the rights needed for certain input for the command, the bot will inform them that the command cannot be executed.

The following limitations also apply:

- Interactive Automation scripts are not supported.

#### 10 June 2022 10 - New feature - New 'Deployments' page in Admin app [ID 33707] [ID 33709] [ID 33724]

In the Admin app, a new *Deployments* page is now available for each DataMiner System connected to dataminer.services. This page provides information about all the deployments that have been done to the DataMiner System via the Nodes page, via the Catalog, or using a GitHub pipeline with our GitHub action. It details what has been deployed, when and by whom, and whether the deployment succeeded, is pending, or failed.

When you click a deployment in the overview, more detailed information will be displayed, including version information and event information that can be used for debugging. For example, in case a pending deployment is queued because of other deployments, you will be able to see this in the event information.

#### 3 June 2022 - New feature - dataminer.services keys [ID 33606]

You can now use dataminer.services keys.

However, more functionality requiring a dataminer.services key is expected to be implemented in the future.

In the Admin app, you can manage the dataminer.services keys on the *Keys* page for each DataMiner System connected to dataminer.services. Each set of keys consists of a (user-defined) label, a primary key, and a secondary key. Inline buttons are available that allow you to view or copy a key. Simply clicking a key entry in the list will open a side panel with detailed information, including when the keys were created and by whom.

For each set of keys, the *...* button on the right opens a menu where you can regenerate the primary key, regenerate the secondary key, or revoke (i.e. delete) the key. With the *New Key* option at the top of the page, you can add more keys.

With the buttons in the response, you can request the alarms of the view or open the view in the Monitoring app via remote access.

In addition, all links to documentation in the app have been adjusted to link to <https://docs.dataminer.services/>.

#### 2 May 2022 - Fix - Not possible to delete share without users [ID 33366]

You can upgrade the installed DxM versions on the nodes and remove nodes that have become obsolete. In case a node has a higher DxM version installed than the current version, it is also possible to downgrade that node.

Note that DataMiner Cloud Pack version 2.5.0 or higher must be installed on the nodes, as otherwise they will not be listed in the Admin app.

#### 28 Feb. 2022 - New feature - dataminer.services connection verification [ID 32741]

In the Admin app, on the *Organization > Manage* page, users can now click a button to send an email to Skyline to have their dataminer.services connection verified. This verification ensures access to the latest dataminer.services features, including the ability to install protocols directly from the dataminer.services catalog.
