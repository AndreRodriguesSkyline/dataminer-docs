### Enhancements

When you click the *Generate driver help* menu command, a Markdown file with extension .md will now be created in the GitHub repository named *dataminer-docs-connectors*.

#### SLDisCSharpAnalysis and SLDisCompiler projects have been replaced by NuGet packages [ID 37536] [ID 37359]

The *SLDisCsharpAnalysis* project has been removed from DIS and NuGet packages have been created and/or extended to replace its functionality:

- New packages:

  - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.CSharpAnalysis.Common
  - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.CSharpAnalysis.Protocol
  - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.Models.Common

- Extended packages:

  - Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.Models.Protocol

The *SLDisCompiler* project has been removed from DIS. Its functionality has been migrated to the existing *Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.Parsers.Protocol* NuGet package and the newly introduced *Skyline.DataMiner.CICD.Assemblers.Protocol* NuGet package.

DIS has also been reworked so that it will now make use of these new/updated NuGet packages.

### Fixes

#### XML editor: Problem when opening a QAction that did not contain the default QAction_{id}.cs file [ID 37358]

An *InvalidOperationException* would be thrown when you tried to open a QAction that did not contain the default *QAction_{id}.cs* file.

- databaseName
- databaseNameProtocol
- sizeHint

#### Validator will now check for duplicate values case-insensitively [ID 37287]

The Validator will now check for duplicate values (e.g. duplicate parameter names) case-insensitively.
