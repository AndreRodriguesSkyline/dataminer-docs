# Creating a Cypress test for an interactive Automation script

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a powerful end-to-end testing framework designed for the modern web. While it simplifies UI testing, leveraging its full potential requires a solid understanding of its core concepts and best practices. This page covers the essential steps to set up, configure, and test an interactive Automation script using Cypress, using an example. By following these steps, you can create reliable, reusable tests to validate new components and UI interactions within a real application environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed. Make sure *Node* has been added to your *PATH* to enable terminal commands.

- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) must be available.

  In the steps below, Visual Studio Code will be mentioned, but a different IDE could be used instead.

- A DataMiner System running DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4]/10.4.7 or higher. <!-- RN 39365 -->

## Project setup and Cypress installation

1. Create a folder for your project (e.g. `C:\Testing`) and open it in Visual Studio Code.

1. Initialize the project and install Cypress:

   1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code and execute the following command:

      ```cmd
      npm init
      ```

   1. Press Enter to proceed through the setup without specifying values until the initialization is complete.

   1. Use the following command to install Cypress:

      ```cmd
      npm install cypress
      ```

1. To simplify running Cypress, add the following line to the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "start": "npx cypress open"
   }
   ```

1. To verify the installation, run `npm run start` to launch Cypress and confirm that it opens successfully.

1. If it is the first time you run Cypress, select *E2E Testing* as the testing type when prompted.

## Creating the interactive Automation script

1. Create an Automation script as a Visual Studio solution, as explained under [Automation scripts as a Visual Studio solution](xref:Automation_scripts_as_a_Visual_Studio_solution).

1. Add the NuGet package [Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.InteractiveAutomationScriptToolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.InteractiveAutomationScriptToolkit/9.0.2) to your project.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Ensure that your project uses at least version 9.0.2 of [Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.InteractiveAutomationScriptToolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.InteractiveAutomationScriptToolkit/9.0.2) and version 10.4.7 of [Skyline.DataMiner.Dev.Automation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skyline.DataMiner.Dev.Automation/10.4.7) to have the *DebugTag* property available on a widget.

1. Use the following C# code to implement a sample interactive script that displays a "Hello, World!" message with an *OK* button:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using Skyline.DataMiner.Automation;
   using Skyline.DataMiner.Utils.InteractiveAutomationScript;

   /// <summary>
   /// Represents a DataMiner Automation script.
   /// </summary>
   public class Script
   {
       /// <summary>
       /// The script entry point.
       /// </summary>
       /// <param name="engine">Link with SLAutomation process.</param>
       public void Run(IEngine engine)
       {
          // DO NOT REMOVE THE COMMENTED OUT CODE BELOW OR THE SCRIPT WILL NOT RUN!
          // Interactive scripts need to be launched differently.
          // This is determined by a simple string search looking for "engine.ShowUI" in the source code.
          // However, due to the NuGet package, this string can no longer be detected.
          // This comment is here as a temporary workaround until it has been fixed.
          //// engine.ShowUI(

          try
          {
             // Controls the event loop and switch between dialogs
             var controller = new InteractiveController(engine);

             // Create an instance of the dialog you wish to show.
             var helloWorldDialog = new HelloWorldDialog(engine);
             
             // Starts the event loop and shows the first dialog.
             controller.ShowDialog(helloWorldDialog);
          }
          catch (ScriptAbortException)
          {
             // Catch normal abort exceptions (engine.ExitFail or engine.ExitSuccess)
             throw; // Comment if it should be treated as a normal exit of the script.
          }
          catch (ScriptForceAbortException)
          {
             // Catch forced abort exceptions, caused via external maintenance messages.
             throw;
          }
          catch (ScriptTimeoutException)
          {
             // Catch timeout exceptions for when a script has been running for too long.
             throw;
          }
          catch (InteractiveUserDetachedException)
          {
             // Catch a user detaching from the interactive script by closing the window.
             // Only applicable for interactive scripts, can be removed for non-interactive scripts.
             throw;
          }
          catch (Exception e)
          {
             engine.ExitFail($"Run|Something went wrong: {e}");
          }
       }
   }

   public class HelloWorldDialog : Dialog
   {
      public HelloWorldDialog(IEngine engine) : base(engine)
      {
          // Create a label widget
          var label = new Label("Hello, World!") { Style = TextStyle.Title };
          
          // Define the debug tag to be used in the cypress test
          label.DebugTag = "label";
          
          // Add it to the dialog grid at position 0,0
          AddWidget(label, 0, 0);
          
          // Create a button widget
          var button = new Button("OK");
          
          // Define the debug tag to be used in the cypress test
          button.DebugTag = "button";
          
          // Add it to the dialog just below the label
          AddWidget(button, 1, 0);
          
          // Add an action to be performed whenever the button is clicked
          button.Pressed += (sender, args) => engine.ExitSuccess("Done");
      }
    }
    ```

## Setting up the web environment

1. [Create a new low-code app](xref:Creating_custom_apps).

1. Add a button to the low-code app and configure it to trigger the created interactive Automation script when clicked.

   For more information, see [Button](xref:DashboardButton).

## Creating the Cypress test

1. In the `cypress/e2e` folder, create a test file with a `.cy.js` extension, such as `HelloWorldDialog.cy.js`.

1. Implement the example Cypress test below to log in, navigate to the low-code app, and interact with the Automation script.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - Ensure all variable values in the test below are updated with the correct information (*dmaAddress*, *username*, *password*, etc.) before you run the test. This allows the script to interact properly with your specific application environment.
   > - In this example, the *DebugTag* defined in the Automation script will be used to verify that the text displayed on a label and button is correct. You should therefore make sure that all *DebugTag* values used in your Automation script are unique per IAS page. This allows you to reference widgets unambiguously during testing. For example, by setting the *DebugTag* for a label to *myLabel*, you will be able to locate the widget in the test using the following code:
   >
   >   ```javascript
   >   cy.get('[data-cy="myLabel"]');
   >   ```

   ```javascript
   describe('Test Interactive Automation Script', () => {
       // Define the necessary variables and replace with your specific details
       const dmaAddress = ''; // Replace with the IP or hostname of a DMA (e.g. 'localhost')
       const username = ''; // Replace with username of a test user
       const password = ''; // Replace with password of the test user
       const buttonLabel = ''; // Replace with the button label
       const appId = ''; // Replace with the app ID

       // Before running the tests, visit the low-code app
       before(() => cy.visit(`http://${dmaAddress}/app/${appId}`));

       it('should log in, execute the Interactive Automation Script, check label and click the button', () => {
           // Check if the login component exists
           cy.get('dma-login').should('exist');

           // Enter login credentials
           cy.get('[data-cy="login.username"]').type(username);
           cy.get('[data-cy="login.password"]').type(password);

           // Click the login button
           cy.contains('dma-button', 'Log on').click();

           // Verify successful login
           cy.get('dma-login').should('not.exist');

           // Start the IAS by clicking the associated button
           cy.contains('dma-button', buttonLabel).click();

           // Validate that the pop-up message appears with the correct title
           cy.get('[data-cy="popup"]').contains('Dialog').should('be.visible');

           // Get the component with the debug tag 'label' and check if the component has the correct text
           cy.get('[data-cy="label"]').should('have.text', 'Hello, World!');

           // Get the component with the debug tag 'button' and click the OK button
           cy.get('[data-cy="button"]').should('have.text', 'OK').click();
       });
   });
   ```

## Running the Cypress test

1. Launch Cypress by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```cmd
   npm run start
   ```

1. Select the test file (`HelloWorldDialog.cy.ts`).

   Cypress will execute the test, displaying results in real time: green indicates success, and any errors are logged in detail for debugging.

   The image below shows the result of a successful test:

   ![CypressTest_IAS_Success](~/develop/images/CypressTest_IAS_Success.png)

1. If you want to test a failure scenario, modify the interactive Automation script by changing the label text from "Hello, World!" to "Goodbye, World!", and run the test again.

   You should now observe a failure because of the mismatch with the expected text. This failure will be reflected in the Cypress results:

   ![CypressTest_IAS_Failure](~/develop/images/CypressTest_IAS_Failure.png)
