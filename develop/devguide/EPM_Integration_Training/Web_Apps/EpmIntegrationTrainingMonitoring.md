# EPM and the Monitoring app

The Monitoring app is crucial for EPM systems, especially when accessing large data sets directly from DataMiner Cube is disabled to enhance performance.

Dealing with EPM elements containing substantial amounts of data can cause performance challenges in DataMiner Cube. To mitigate this, you can use the Monitoring web app instead. This way you can access this critical data without increasing the load on the system, ensuring efficiency and stability in data management and visualization within the EPM environment.
