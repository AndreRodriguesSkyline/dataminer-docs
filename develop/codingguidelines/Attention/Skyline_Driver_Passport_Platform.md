# Skyline Driver Passport Platform

- A DataMiner Test package has been created and scheduled on the Driver Passport Platform in order to validate performance metrics as part of the Code Review process or when deemed useful. Supported connections are SNMP (v1 to v3) and HTTP.

> [!TIP]
> The CI/CD pipeline automatically creates and schedules a test on the Driver Passport Platform for an initial range if the required simulation files are provided. For more information, refer to [Prepare Driver Passport Platform scheduling](xref:Pipeline_stages_for_protocols#prepare-driver-passport-platform-scheduling).
