# Best practices for protocol development

This section lists best practices and guidelines designed to uphold the quality level of DataMiner protocols (a.k.a. connectors) by improving readability, maintainability, and performance.

By adhering to these best practices and guidelines, you can ensure that protocols have a consistent look and thereby increase maintainability and readability, and you will also increase the reusability, stability, and performance of the protocols you develop.

A checklist is available [on DataMiner Dojo](https://community.dataminer.services/protocol-development-downloads/), which should be used whenever a new protocol version is created. In the checklist, verify every item and specify "OK", "Fail", or "NA", as appropriate.

> [!NOTE]
> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this section are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 (see <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>).
