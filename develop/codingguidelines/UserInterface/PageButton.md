# Page buttons

## Dimensions

The width of a page button must be explicitly defined in the protocol. A minimum width of 110 is advised. Only use a larger value when necessary. However, keep the width of page buttons as uniform as possible (e.g. in case there are two page buttons and for one page button a width of 120 is required, it is better to also set the width of the other page button to 120).

## Labels

The label of a page button must always end with an ellipsis ("..."), so a distinction can be made between a page button and a regular button. The ellipsis must immediately follow the label, so no space is allowed before the ellipsis (e.g. "Configure..." instead of "Configure ...").

## Content

Page buttons are used to display a limited amount of data. A pop-up window opened by means of a page button should contain either data of less importance or data that should remain visible while users are working on other pages.

A pop-up page opened by means of a page button should not contain page buttons.
