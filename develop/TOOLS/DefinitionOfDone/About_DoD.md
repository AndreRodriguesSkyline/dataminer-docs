# Definition of Done (DoD) tool

The Definition of Done tool is a web application designed to automate and streamline the process of managing task completion workflows. It ensures all required steps are clearly outlined, tracked, documented, and completed to maintain quality standards in development projects.

Additionally, the tool supports efficient work by providing convenient links and automated features that simplify task completion and adherence to procedures.

## Purpose

This tool helps development teams by:

- **Automating task workflow management** to ensure all required steps are completed before marking a task as done.

- **Improving quality assurance** through structured checklists and validation processes.

- **Enhancing team collaboration** via integration with Microsoft Teams and other collaboration tools.

- **Streamlining documentation** by automatically generating and organizing project documentation.

- **Tracking time and progress** through built-in time registration and progress monitoring features.

## Accessing the DoD tool

1. Navigate to the [DoD tool home page](https://dod.skyline.be) (available to Skyline employees only).

1. Sign in with your Azure AD credentials.

You can now access tasks through the [main interface](#user-interface).

## Using the DoD tool

### Working with tasks

1. On the DoD tool home page, enter a task ID and click the blue *Open* button, or navigate directly to `https://dod.skyline.be/task/{taskId}`.

1. Review the automatically generated DoD checklist.

1. Update the status of each DoD step by selecting *TODO*, *DONE*, or *SKIP STEP*.

1. In the *Guard* column, assign responsible team members to each step.

1. In the *Comment* column, provide additional context or reasons when skipping steps.
