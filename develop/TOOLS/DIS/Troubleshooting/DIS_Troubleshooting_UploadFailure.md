# Publishing problems

## Problem

Publishing a connector or script fails, possibly with a message from DataMiner.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure your account has the [required DataMiner permissions](xref:Prerequisites#required-user-permissions).

- Make sure your DataMiner System uses DataMiner [10.0.9](xref:General_Feature_Release_10.0.9#dataminer-application-packages-id-25911id-26027id-26169id-26243id-26271id-26338id-26351id-26371) or higher.
