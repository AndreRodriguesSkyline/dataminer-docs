# Getting started with CI/CD using GitHub

If you and your organization are ready to dive into GitHub, you will first need to set up your development environment. The easiest way to do so is by following our tutorial [Setting up your development environment in GitHub](xref:CICD_Tutorial_GitHub_Code_To_Product).

Then you can start developing, releasing, and optionally deploying any supported DataMiner artifacts with a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub. To learn how to do so, follow the tutorial [From code to product](xref:CICD_Tutorial_GitHub_Code_To_Product).

If you are specifically looking to create a custom pipeline to deploy connectors, follow the tutorial [Setting up basic CI/CD for connector deployment](xref:CICD_Tutorial_Connector).
