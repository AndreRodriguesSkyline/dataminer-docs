# Ember+

Ember+ is a control protocol defined by the Lawo Group, allowing communication between two endpoints: a data provider (typically a device exposing a set of controllable parameters) and a consumer (typically a monitoring system).

The Ember+ specification consists of three parts:

- Glow: The data schema defining the data types used to convey Ember+ information.

- EmBER: The encoding used to store instances of the Glow-defined types.

- S101: The framing protocol used to transmit EmBER encoded data.
